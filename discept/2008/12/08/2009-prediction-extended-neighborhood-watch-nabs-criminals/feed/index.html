					<description><![CDATA[Everything is becoming a crime.
I wish I had more of a sense of being a criminal.
I like to run around naked.
That is probably a crime.
I have a paranoia that all police are taking bribes on the side and that they
sell crack.
also: I believe the NSA sweeps the globe taking satellite pictures and
           that only the crimes they want unsolved stay that way.
  and I also believe they have to let enough crime get through to justify even
   more laws that aren&#039;t needed because it is already illegal to kill people
if you hate them while your doing it...what does that mean?
  Any murder would be a hate crime! 
I realize that I have probably just broken several laws, and ask to be excused
for time served on this rotating orb of a prison.]]></description>
