Was the original &quot;Thee Process is...&quot; document the same as the one found on the reconstructed Transmedia web-site that caused confustion regarding your landlord and such?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Above, william wrote: &#062;
&#062; Youâ€™ll find most of our links on the side bar are geared towards getting the old neurons humming... 
&#062; Itâ€™s my hope that we can inspire each other not only to think and speak. But also to act.

Awesome!
BTW, let me intro myself:
I grew up in Chicago where I came across the ToPY movement in about... ummm... the late &#039;80s or early &#039;90s.  I met the head of the ToPY contact point in Chicago and (separately - through the music scene) I met Jim Marcus (Die Warzau, PigFace, O23, etc.)  and became good friends of both.  Each of them, and a man I met at &quot;The Occult Bookstore&quot; passed on information and knowledge to me which (for lack ov better wordz) helped me to open my &quot;third eye&quot;.  A few years later, they both introduced me to Gen (when he was passing through Chicago) who told me an amazing story, which at first I did not believe, until Jim confirmed that what Gen was saying was not some bizarre &quot;performance art&quot;/fictional-story.  I think that was when I fell so far down the rabbit hole that it would be better to start digging deeper than to try to climb out.

OK, I think that is enough... for now at least... maybe I will put more on my bio page later... but I just wanted to wish everyone involved with this project a Powerful-&quot;New&quot;-Year!

Namaste,
Sighris]]></description>
