					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Christ said: Love thine enemy. Christ&#039;s Enemy was Satan and Satan&#039;s Enemy was Christ. Through love, enmity is destroyed. Through love, saint and sinner destroy the enmity between them. Through love, Christ and Satan have destroyed their enmity and come together for the End. Christ to judge, Satan to execute the judgment.&lt;/i&gt;  - Robert Moor (aka &#039;DeGrimston&#039;)

&lt;i&gt;For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? &lt;/i&gt;  - St. Paul
