	<div id="date">by <a href="../../../../author/doug/index.html" title="Posts by doug" rel="author">doug</a> &nbsp;&mdash; &nbsp;October 19, 2012</div>
	<p>Dear Dr. Phil,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I write this letter to you with little hope of conveying information of which you were previously unaware. Rather, I write this letter so that the general public may be made aware of what <em>you should already be well aware of</em>, in hopes that they may appropriately measure your credibility following your forthcoming broadcast* related to the topic of an alleged satanic cult conspiracy &#8212; an episode which promises to be full of misinformation, delusions, harmful false accusations, and lies.<span id="more-967"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, it has come to my attention that you will be airing an interview with Judy Byington, author of a book entitled <em><a href="http://www.examiner.com/review/the-lunatics-are-all-therapists-a-review-of-22-faces-by-judy-byington?cid=db_articles">Twenty-Two Faces</a></em> which purports to be the true story of one Jenny Hill, an alleged victim of the bizarre and controversial psychiatric condition known as Dissociative Identity Disorder [DID] (formerly listed as Multiple Personality Disorder [MPD]).</p>
<p dir="ltr">However <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/a-story-that-doesnt-hold-up/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow">dubious the legitimacy of DID</a>, this diagnosis is by far the least of the problems with Byington’s book. <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> is openly rife with archaic demonologies, and paranoid conspiracy theories being presented as root causes to the disturbances in Ms. Hill’s troubled mind. That Jenny Hill &#8212; a former drug addict and prostitute with a history of mental illness &#8212; is troubled seems indisputable, but Byington’s book seeks to expose an alleged satanic government plot behind Hill’s mental malaise that is tantamount to speculation upon who, exactly, is beaming voices into the heads of schizophrenics. Such an ignorant approach to therapeutic practice is harmful to mental health consumers, and your endorsement of such can hardly be of any positive value to your viewers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader harm to the public mental health in endorsing a story as laden with paranoid delusion as <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> &#8212; especially insofar as it is a narrative specifically appealing to the mentally vulnerable &#8212; should be clear to a doctor of Clinical Psychology like yourself. In fact, as recently as the 1980’s (and extending into the 90s), stories of non-existent satanic cults &#8212; upon which Byington has based her unhinged claims &#8212; caused a modern witch-hunt now known to sociologists as the “<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Satanic_Panic">Satanic Panic</a>”. Books foundational to this panic, and thematically identical to <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> &#8212; particularly <em>Michelle Remembers</em> by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith, and <em>Satan’s Underground</em> by Lauren Stratford &#8212; were soundly and thoroughly debunked by investigative journalists. Unfortunately, these debunkings only arrived after sensational talk-shows, promoting these books uncritically, helped create <a href="http://altreligion.about.com/od/satanism/f/satanic_panic.htm">a moral panic</a> that ruined families, resulted in false convictions of satanic crimes, and exploited the most irrational fears of countless mental health consumers. Both of these books are listed in Byington’s bibliography, despite their debunkings, and despite the fact the Satan’s Underground was <a href="http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html">so thoroughly discredited</a> as to be withdrawn from publication&#8230; following which the author changed her name and abandoned her story of Satanic Ritual Abuse to instead pose as a childhood victim of the Holocaust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the supernatural claims put forward in<em> Twenty-Two Faces</em> we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prophecy:</strong> The protagonist’s birth is foretold by her uncle in exacting detail. Through some other-worldly messenger he is “told” that “this was a special child who would do important things on this earth.”</li>
<li><strong>Extra Sensory Perception (ESP):</strong> apparently believing that child abuse can prove beneficial to the victim (a position I hope you disagree with), author Judy Byington describes that the protagonist, Jenny Hill, was able to break through certain subliminal barriers, not in spite of, but because of, early humiliations. “In the far reaches of her brain a storehouse of demeaning events evidently opened a door for Extra Sensory Perception experiences to enter.”</li>
<li><strong>Divine guidance:</strong> desperate and in prayer, Jenny Hill hears “a soft, yet thundering voice”, which urges her to “continue to write down your life experiences, for one day a book will be written.”</li>
<li><strong>Levitation:</strong> Byington describes a cult “filled with Black Magic, levitation, seances and chanting people”. Jenny Hill is admonished at one point that “[l]evitation and evil spirits weren’t anything to mess around with and certainly not worth the price it [sic] would extract.”</li>
<li><strong>Divine intervention:</strong> In the midst of a Satanic ceremony in which she is bound to an altar, Jenny Hill is spared from sacrifice by a bare-footed “white-robed male personage, surrounded in a glorious White Light”. (Had this “personage” taken a little effort to arrive just a moment earlier, he could have spared the unlucky girl next to Hill, who is said to have been decapitated&#8230; but I’m sure His schedule is as busy as His ways mysterious.)</li>
<li><strong>Spirit Possession:</strong> Making clear that possession isn’t merely a more primitive cultural interpretation of DID, Byington describes that Hill has suffered both DID and spirit possession, the latter being cured by the prayers of LDS church officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any one of these topics would be a bit much for one episode, and each of these remarkable claims demands remarkable evidence. So what evidence does Byington provide? Incredibly, <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> seems to rely solely on the “memories of [Jenny Hill’s] multiple personalities and their entries in diaries written since childhood”, as Byington describes in the book’s opening disclaimer. These memories were “repressed”, only recalled later in Ms. Hill’s life in the course of re-integrating her various fractured identities. Setting aside the fact that “recovered memories” similarly serve as the “evidentiary” basis for claims of Extraterrestrial abductions and past life regression, is it appropriate &#8212; in your professional opinion as a (former) Clinical Psychologist &#8212; to accept such extraordinary claims merely on personal testimony? Do you think it’s appropriate, Dr. Phil, to air fear-mongering claims of an anti-human, ubiquitous secret society on the “evidence” of such an unlikely anecdote?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even looking past the supernatural propositions, Byington’s book is fraught with inconsistencies, among which we find:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Twenty-Two Faces is said to have been constructed from “memories of [Jenny Hill’s] multiple personalities and their entries in diaries written since childhood”, a claim which makes no sense when considering that Jenny Hill is supposed to have been entirely ignorant of the existence of her multiple personalities until having entered psychiatric therapy in later adulthood. How, then, did she account for various unknown individuals writing their own personal, signed entries in her own private diaries consistently throughout her life?</li>
<li>Twenty-Two Faces describes that Jenny Hill was oppressed by an unlikely Jewish Nazi who worshipped Satan and was brought to the US from Germany under CIA sponsorship. Ludicrous as this alone is, Byington explains that this over-dramatized villain is careful to conceal his antics from Jenny Hill’s parents &#8212; returning her home on-time for supper, making sure her chores are finished before compelling her to return &#8212; yet we also learn later that Hill’s parents were in on the whole thing throughout.</li>
<li>We are made to understand that Hill begins to experience “lost time” at the age of 4, when her abuse is said to have begun. The lost time is accounted for as episodes during which other personalities took over her consciousness so that Hill might not be troubled with the terrors of the abuse she began suffering at that age. Such episodes, starting at such an early age, would establish an expectation of occasionally lost time, or an acceptance on the part of the protagonist that she had never quite grasped what time is. Not so with Ms. Hill. Not only did she fully grasp the cultural context and broad implications of the depravities that are said to have befallen her at age 4, she is also uncannily aware of the dates and times that eluded her at an age when most children are unable to properly read a clock. Does this match with your own knowledge of childhood cognitive development, Dr. Phil?</li>
<li>Hill learns, by means of &#8220;recovered memories&#8221; that she was raped by her father. She invites her parents to her psychiatric hospital, where she is an in-patient, so that she may accuse him. Apparently heartbroken and outraged, her father storms out. The inconsistency occurs some pages later when it is reported that Hill was saddened to not be invited over for the following Family Christmas.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">You should be aware of serious problems with Byington’s book &#8212; the inconsistencies, improbabilities, and supernatural propositions &#8212; not least because you should be aware of the book’s contents before you endorse such material on your show, but also because<em> I personally reached out to your producers to warn you of them</em>. Your producers were surely also warned regarding Byington’s problematic narrative when in contact with Jenny Hill’s sister, who was also asked to appear on your show along with Mrs. Byington. Apparently, your producers &#8212; doing “entertainment” at the expense of good psychology &#8212; chose to ignore us both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The material above covers some problems that any rational person could pick out merely from reading the book, but there are further problems with <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> that are apparent to anybody who bothers to do a little research:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The book carries an endorsement from Robert Kroon, an esteemed former foreign correspondent for Time Magazine. However, Kroon had been dead for over 5 years at the time of Twenty-Two Faces’ publication</strong>. Suspiciously, Tate Publishing, the publisher of Twenty-Two Faces, uses <a href="http://www.tatepublishing.com/bookstore/book.php?w=978-1-60696-886-4">a similar endorsement</a>, allegedly from Kroon, on another book published 2 years after his death.</li>
<li><strong>Judy Byington has not had a license to practice therapy in around 10 years, yet she explicitly describes continuing to conduct therapy sessions with Jenny Hill only months ago</strong> (listen to this interview at 15:45: <a href="http://kcpw.org/blog/cityviews/2012-08-07/cityviews-8812-one-woman-multiple-personalitiesbullets-and-belles/">http://kcpw.org/blog/cityviews/2012-08-07/cityviews-8812-one-woman-multiple-personalitiesbullets-and-belles/</a>). Judy Byington also offers “therapy” over the phone or via Skype at $25 per session. Do you, Dr. Phil, endorse this type of unlicensed, not to mention grossly irrational, “therapy”?</li>
<li><strong>Jenny Hill remains mentally tormented and has a history of bearing false witness</strong>. <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> describes an episode in which Jenny Hill fled from Judy Byington for a time believing that she had observed “the mark of cain” somewhere on Byington, indicated that Byington was involved, somehow, with satanic cults… yet it never seems to have occurred to Byington that any other paranoid claims of Jenny’s may have been rooted in suspicious delusion, rather than fact. In a very telling exchange (that can be read here: <a href="http://dysgenicsreport.blogspot.com/2012/10/replies-to-22-faces-claims-hard.html#more">http://dysgenicsreport.blogspot.com/2012/10/replies-to-22-faces-claims-hard.html#more</a>) Jenny Hill’s sister questioned Byington regarding why it is Byington unquestioningly believes many of Jenny’s unprovable claims, while knowing that Jenny has made various unfounded claims in apparent fits of panicked paranoia: “Did you believe her when she said your husband was coming on to her sexually? I have heard that allegation too many times about other men to take it seriously. [&#8230;] [H]ow many times has she called you in the middle of the night to come rescue her from some drama only to find her asleep and not knowing she had called or claiming she was being held hostage and you come with police to find her watching TV[?] …” Judy Byington proved unwilling or unable to answer these questions of Jenny Hill’s sister. Was she able to answer such questions of you? Did you even ask? If not, why not? These facts were available to you before you filmed your interview with Mrs. Byington.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">I hardly expect to see that you have asked any difficult, yet terribly obvious, questions of Judy Byington in your soon-to-be-aired interview, as Byington’s own website now proudly displays your endorsement:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">“Dear Judy,</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Thank you for taking the time to come to our show. I wish you great success with your book documenting the life of Jenny Hill and look forward to working with you in the future. God Bless!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr. Phil, Paramount Pictures Hollywood”</h3>
<p>That this makes you complicit in purveying a delusional conspiracy theory is unfortunate, but hardly disputable. Judy Byington herself <a href="http://www.shewrites.com/profiles/blogs/guest-post-from-judy-byington-author-of-22-faces">makes clear</a> that she considers Dissociative Identity Disorder/Multiple Personality Disorder synonymous with Satanic Ritual Abuse, and you can hardly talk to her about one without addressing the other. To be clear, when Judy Byington talks of multiplicity and dissociative trauma, she is talking about a debunked conspiracy theory of satanic mind-control plots. That you should give such hysterical claims air-time &#8212; allowing a conspiracy theory to be presented as a diagnosis &#8212; on your widely viewed show is beyond irresponsible. It makes you a menace to the public mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have no illusion that you will correct your errors, or that you might pull the episode before it airs. Rather, I am simply posting this time-stamped letter to you here &#8212; which I will also send to you directly &#8212; so that neither you, nor your producers, may possibly claim ignorance in the near future when Judy Byington meets with the critical assault that will inevitably follow when sensible people see fit to read her work. I want it to be perfectly clear, now and in the future, that all the facts were available to you at all times. It is my feeling that your credibility should greatly suffer, and it is my wish that you should soon find yourself as bankrupt financially as you are ethically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <em>*Note, original reports stated that this episode would air October 31, 2012. As of October 27, this episode is not on Dr. Phil&#8217;s broadcasting schedule.

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>On the 27th, October, Dr. Phil’s website listed the schedule for the week ahead with Byington’s interview excluded. Byington posted a comment that the episode would, however, air “soon”. A search of Dr. Phil’s site for the name “Byington” currently yields no results. It’s too early to say for certain, but it seems Phil may be reconsidering airing this outrageous and irresponsible filth.<br />
Since I posted my open letter, I have received an unprecedented response from readers who share my concerns regarding the purveyance of bizarre and harmful delusions being coerced into vulnerable mental health consumers and creating a public atmosphere of witch-hunting panic. One reader decided to check up on Judy Byington&#8217;s claim to be a consultant on &#8220;Satanic crimes&#8221; for the Utah Attorney General&#8217;s office. She wrote to them asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear UAG</p>
<p>Is it true that Judy Byington has been a consultant on &#8220;satanic crime&#8221; for your office since 2006?</p>
<p>She claims as such on her website:</p>
<p><a href="http://22faces.com/press-kit/" rel="nofollow">http://22faces.com/press-kit/</a></p>
<p>If so, this is very concerning. I hope you realise that 99% of &#8220;satanic ritual abuse&#8221; is a fabrication by the &#8220;therapist&#8221; and sometimes the mistreated patient.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse</a></p>
<p>Yours faithfully [&#8230;] </p></blockquote>
<p>The Attorney General&#8217;s office replied in no uncertain terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site says Byington has acted as a consultant on satanic crime for the Utah AG&#8217;s Office since 2006.  The Utah AG has not had any consultants on satanic crime since 2006 or any time, and certainly has not used Byington in any capacity including as a consultant, ever.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, and despite my having sent the station a version of my Dr. Phil letter in advance, an ABC affiliate in Utah decided to run a story about Judy Byington that presented none of the disturbing questions I provided them. Putting the irresponsible report on their website after airing it on television, the comments section soon became deluged with angry demands that the story be corrected, the facts be checked, the questions confronted. Kimberly Nelson, the anchor responsible for the story has failed to act responsibly as a journalist, and she has still failed to reply to any of the criticisms, even as the comments bled over onto her Facebook page. The station, instead of answering to any concerns, simply pulled the ability to comment from the piece. As people emailed the station directly, there was only one simple reply: &#8220;We stand by our story&#8221;. What this means is unclear. Do they mean that they still believe their story to be accurate, despite their apparent unwillingness to confront all of the evidence? Did they find a way to reconcile the discrepancies with Byington&#8217;s story? Or do they simply mean that they will air what they like, and they don&#8217;t see a need to over-burden themselves with cumbersome fact-checks?</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>To the supreme IDIOTS who commend Mr. Jew Mesner for trying to suppress very crucial information about the horrors of trauma-based MK Ultra mind CONtrol&#8230;.SHAME ON YOU, for either being so IGNORANT, and SHAME ON YOU MORE for being COMPLICIT in this cover-up! My first concern was, why is this JEW so concerned about not having this story aired on national TV? WHAT IS HE SO AFRAID OF???? WHY IS HE GOING TO SO MUCH TROUBLE??? And most importatntly, WHO IS HE TRYING TO PROTECT??? Is it b/c the horror was perpetrated by a JEW? Dr. GreenBAUM? When the truth comes out that many JEWS were responsible for millions of deaths before, during, and esp. AFTER WW2, will the idiot fringe jump on the band wagon, or not believe it b/c it goes against their  life-long hollowHOAX programming? MK Ultra is rampant, and I have met 2 victims myself&#8230;PERSONALLY.<br />
One victim was abused at Bnai Brth in Hamilton, Ont. And satanic ritual abuse goes hand in hand with MK. The other victim was  SRAed when he was a child by the Priminister of CanaDUH P.E. Trudeau, a known homosexual/Jesuit. It&#8217;s WAKEY WAKEY time idiots!<br />

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>Why, thank you, Nick Kennedy, for providing us with one of your rather predictable rants which manages to work &#8220;the Jewish question&#8221; into everything, whether it makes sense or not.<br />
Assuming you actually read my open letter to Dr. Phil at all, you may want to revisit it and look over my straight-forward objections to the topic material. You seem to assume I&#8217;m Jewish, then you go on to speculate that I&#8217;m merely covering for the crimes of a Jew &#8212; the Jewish Nazi Satanist from the CIA who acts as the villain in 22 Faces.<br />
To tell you truth, it wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;Jew&#8221; part of the Dr. Greenbaum equation that gave me serious reservations as to the veracity of the book (though it seems obvious to me that he is a fictional character made Jewish for the satisfaction of discerning readers like yourself). In fact, what I find most suspect is that the protagonist of the story was born under the auspice of prophecy, was endowed with ESP as a result of early abuse, dabbled in levitation, suffered demonic possession, heard the voice of God, and was saved by a dramatic divine intervention.<br />
Do you believe all of these things, Nick? Has your experience of supposedly meeting 2 people victimized by MK-Ultra shown you the reality of all these items of supernaturalism? Or are you simply obligated to believe any claim, no matter how irrational, if only a Jewish enemy is invoked?<br />
And what of the narrative discrepancies in the book? Were you able to reconcile those?</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>All of these symptoms you describe are from MK Ultra trauma-based mind control, (the victim I met was micro-chipped)and we all have ESP abilities, it&#8217;s just that most are too dumbed down to develop them. Mesner is a JEW name, and I don&#8217;t trust any JEW. Most of these &#8220;voices&#8221; are psy-ops from the CIA. It is actually quite common for those who know how the jUSA Govt. operates. I haven&#8217;t read the book, but I may buy it now to support this woman who is REVEALING what you are trying so hard to HIDE.  It&#8217;s too little too late Mr. Jew. The sheeple are awakening!<br />
BTW, I am not typing this for your benefit, but the 4 or 5 people who read your BS blogs!<br />

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>I see, Nick! So levitation is a &#8220;symptom&#8221;? How is being born under the auspice of prophecy a result of MK-Ultra? How is divine intervention? What of demonic possession? If that&#8217;s a side-effect of MK-Ultra programming, why did the CIA make it so susceptible to the exorcising prayers of Mormon Church officials?<br />
But then, you haven&#8217;t even read the book. Nor does it seem you actually read the piece you&#8217;re commenting on. Nor can you speak to the narrative inconsistencies in the book, uninformed as you are. Nor am I Jewish. And if I was, it certainly would do nothing to validate the absurd claims in the book of which you are ignorant.<br />
Also, why is it that there are herds of credulous morons who all seem to use the same ironic phrase to describe the rest of the world in their mindless parroting of their most cherished delusions: &#8220;sheeple&#8221;?<br />
So, go ahead, Nick, read 22 Faces, then read my letter, and then perhaps you&#8217;ll be prepared to actually have a discussion on the topic.</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>The ONLY claim I am making here is that MK Ultra mind control is real, so is SRA, and it has been called the SILENT HOLOCAUST by some, b/c it is so WIDESPREAD/RAMPANT.

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>So let&#8217;s be clear here, Nick: You say that &#8220;MK Ultra is real, so is SRA&#8221;, and so, by extension, this book (which you&#8217;ve never read, by your own admission) is necessarily a true story?<br />

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>It&#8217;s one of the enduring paradoxes that the simplest of minds are always also the most frustrating to try and understand. Thus we have this afro-centric Jihadist, Nick Kennedy, presuming to ask me why (or &#8220;WHY&#8221;) I am trying so hard, as he sees it, to &#8220;suppress&#8221; 22 Faces. </p>
<p>I suppose, Nick, that you&#8217;re trying to boil it down to one question to save face for your asinine entry wherein it was quickly revealed that you hadn&#8217;t read the book in question, and it was quite obvious you failed to grasp, or possibly even read, the piece itself upon which you are commenting. One wonders if you had read a negative review of one of the Harry Potter books if the first question to occur to you would have been, &#8220;why are they trying to suppress this book?&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t know, Nick, perhaps you should read the criticisms of the book and see if you can figure out what my issues with it are. I&#8217;m pretty clear in my presentation, you should be able comprehend at least some of it. </p>
<p>You claim the Holocaust is a hoax. WHY are you trying so hard to suppress the Holocaust? You see how this idiotic &#8220;logic&#8221; can be applied either way? Any criticism becomes &#8220;suppression&#8221;. (To be clear, this question was raised only to illustrate a point. I&#8217;m really not interested in hearing your empty-headed theories.)</p>
<p>You ask, &#8220;If this is so ridiculous&#8221; why do I try to &#8220;suppress&#8221; it? Of course, this is only an &#8220;If&#8221; because you apparently have no idea what the book is even about. It&#8217;s not a question of &#8220;if&#8221; the book is ridiculous. The book clearly is ridiculous, unless, of course, you really believe (as you implied) that levitation is a “symptom” of MK-Ultra, as is being born under the auspice of prophecy, divine intervention &#038; demonic possession (of a peculiarly Mormon context).</p>
<p>Of course, you can again try to broaden your argument into something very generalized, as you did earlier &#8212; perhaps in some bit of recognition as to what a dip-shit you come off as &#8212; and say that ALL you are claiming is that MK-Ultra and SRA exist. Why you would come here and try to say &#8220;just&#8221; that, while the topic is a specific book and a specific broadcast is entirely unclear, but even then you come with no better tools than to accuse me of being a &#8220;Jew&#8221; and thus invested in suppressing important information. Leaving the problem of definition aside, let&#8217;s just assume you&#8217;re right (against all odds) and that whatever you mean when you say MK-Ultra and SRA really are cold realities. Just for argument&#8217;s sake, you can have that. So what does that mean for my criticisms of this book? Nothing. They all still stand. The story needs to be judged on its own merits, and you&#8217;ve not even bothered to read it. You&#8217;ve decided, apparently, that it must be true, because you&#8217;ve also decided (and we can see what competent judge of evidence you are) that MK-Ultra and SRA are alive and well today. This is fallacious logic that anybody who passed kindergarten should recognize intuitively.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put it like this, Nick: Say I were to tell you that a werewolf stole the horn off of my pet unicorn&#8217;s head? Would you believe me? If you did not, on the grounds that perhaps you feel that unicorns and werewolves don&#8217;t exist (I&#8217;m giving you an unearned benefit of the doubt), would it be appropriate for me to chastise you and shout that you are trying to &#8220;suppress&#8221; the fact that theft exists?  (and this analogy gives your definitions of MK-Ultra and SRA themselves the unearned benefit of being as established of realities as theft, offering your position a degree of credibility I&#8217;ve gone well out-of-the-way to extend, and it still doesn&#8217;t make for a rational argument)</p>

            <div class='commenttext-admin'><p>As for dodged questions directly relevant to the topic here, here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>
<p>&#8212; Has your experience of supposedly meeting 2 people victimized by MK-Ultra shown you the reality of all these items of supernaturalism? </p>
<p>&#8212; Or are you simply obligated to believe any claim, no matter how irrational, if only a Jewish enemy is invoked?</p>
<p>&#8212; And what of the narrative discrepancies in the book? Were you able to reconcile those?</p>
<p>&#8212; levitation is a “symptom” [of MK-Ultra]? </p>
<p>&#8212; How is being born under the auspice of prophecy a result of MK-Ultra? </p>
<p>&#8212; How is divine intervention [a result of MK-Ultra]? </p>
<p>&#8211;What of demonic possession? If that’s a side-effect of MK-Ultra programming, why did the CIA make it so susceptible to the exorcising prayers of Mormon Church officials?</p>
<p>&#8212; You say that “MK Ultra is real, so is SRA”, and so, by extension, this book (which you’ve never read, by your own admission) is necessarily a true story?</p>
<p>&#8212; Leaving the problem of definition aside, let’s just assume you’re right (against all odds) and that whatever you mean when you say MK-Ultra and SRA really are cold realities. Just for argument’s sake, you can have that. So what does that mean for my criticisms of this book?</p>
<p>&#8212; Let’s put it like this, Nick: Say I were to tell you that a werewolf stole the horn off of my pet unicorn’s head? Would you believe me? If you did not, on the grounds that perhaps you feel that unicorns and werewolves don’t exist (I’m giving you an unearned benefit of the doubt), would it be appropriate for me to chastise you and shout that you are trying to “suppress” the fact that theft exists?</p>
<p>So it seems all the dodging has been on your end. But then, you&#8217;ve not read the book either, and now you&#8217;re trying to shift senselessly to another topic&#8230;</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>I have read &#8220;Trance&#8221; by Cathy O&#8217;Brien, and lots of Springmeier&#8217;s stuff, as well as Brice Taylor&#8217;s book. Then tons of stuff over 15 years about MK on-line. The victim I actually lived with for 3 hellish weeks was BIG TIME MPD. When I told her she was a MK victim, her memories of abuse, and SRA came flooding back to her. The stories she told me after were corroborated with what I had read previously, years before. Of course she was a whore, and in the sex trade b/c all of the females, and some male victims are programmed for that to earn money for these satanic sickos. I saw a little girl personality also, and a intelligent one too. I think she was programmed for legal work.<br />
 Using logic, common sense, and being able to read LIARS like yourself is also a gift I have.lol It&#8217;s frustrating trying to deceive someone who is ON to you, and knows his stuff isn&#8217;t it?  The POS who perpetrate this, and the ones who try to protect them are the lowest SCUM on the Planet. How does that feel? OOps, I forgot, the JEW has no compassion, and fakes emotion, but is an excellent LIAR, CHEAT.<br />

I wouldn&#8217;t know, Nick, you came here not having read the book in question, with no understanding of the piece I have written, and with no ability to answer any of questions put to you.</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>Oh my goodness Russ Hook, you say your friend who you actually lived with for three weeks was a  &#8220;BIG TIME MPD&#8221;  ! How hard that must have been on you Russ, certainly that experience along with the tons of on-line stuff you read must make you an expert on things like that eh ?<br />
I know I sure feel like an expert on stuff like that after being a &#8220;BIG TIME MPD&#8221; once myself. Yes indeed, I spent five years as a patient of Dr.Colin Ross, the guy who wrote the forward to Judy Byington&#8217;s book &#8220;22 Faces&#8221;, and I lived too tell all about it. Well that is actually pretty easy for me now that my friend Doug Mesner wrote that article about my experiences at the hands of my old psychiatrist Colin Ross. Check it out:<br />

I can&#8217;t say that I agree with anything you&#8217;ve said in your comments but you sure have a way of putting the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; in everywhere you can, I never seen anything like it, but then I have never spent any time on any White Supremesist web sites. Well have a nice day Russ, I&#8217;m glad to know that you&#8217;re out there and I&#8217;m way over here.</p>
