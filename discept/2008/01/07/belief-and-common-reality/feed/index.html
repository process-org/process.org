					<description><![CDATA[I was going to buy a book from an ad in  TIME magazine  called  &quot;Null Physics&quot;

Which stated it went far beyond &quot;string cheese theory&quot; and &quot;Chaos Math&quot;,

to some kind of &quot;black hole&quot; stuff that explained it all. Making everything else

obsolete.   &quot;This is the future!&quot;

Wanting to impress my Dad , who has a chemistry degree, I mentioned it and he
said it was a bunch of crap. 

I still might buy it for the pictures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m less certain that people have given up the belief in science as much as those who never really understood have become more vocal and more widely listened to. 

With scientific inquiry attacked by both those who chose pre-rational faith as their main approach towards life and those who choose &quot;Only the subjective is real&quot; as their primary philosophical orientation the sciences have slipped further and further from the grasp of both the &quot;common citizen&quot; and &quot;the intellectual&quot; classes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps you can consider your exchange with W a success. From what you&#039;ve stated it appears as though she was able to examine her perceptions of science and then rationally sort them into &quot;ok, this is science, this is not.&quot; And if she wasn&#039;t too shamed by the experience, she&#039;ll be able to call upon it in future thought &#038; future exchanges with others, using the &quot;pillar&quot; as a sturdy context from which to judge the wifty ideas bandied about by the likes of Chopra &#038; the producers/most of the cast of What the Bleep do We Know? 

There&#039;s a danger in a assuming that everyone should possess critical thinking skills and a basic understanding of what science is and is not -- then being overwhelmed by the disappointment of the reality (disappointment taking many lovely flavors...a sense of entitlement, sanctimony [i&#039;m having a chuckle about the use of this word in this context], uselessly railing, poignant sense of isolation, etc) such that the critical thinker&#039;s powers of social catalysis are rendered flaccid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I mean was more-or-so Quantum Physics and the chaos science that states that whatever we observe objectivly may not be as it seems.

There is no one certain way to perceve things, as we all have different perceptions, which builds our reality. I could go on and on regarding microchosims and macrochosims in relation to the human brain, but ill just leave my reply to this to answer your question.

I also lean toward a chaos magick and neitsche philosophy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good Point...

My Mom got sucked into that Secret Crap, and she used to repeat it non-stop, because she beleived it would hard-wire her mind to make it work.

I pissed her off once by deliberitly buying &#039;What the $^&#038;!&#038; do we Know&#039;.

What the Bleep was ok, if your new to that type of thing. 

But come on people, stop being narrow minded.

 I choose Chaos.]]></description>
