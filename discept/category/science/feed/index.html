								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>By Lucien Greaves</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday, May 08, 2015, multimillionaire Manhattan socialite, Gigi Jordan, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the manslaughter of her eight-year old autistic son, Jude Michael Mirra.  </span></p>
<p>Jordan never denied that she had intended to kill her child by way of forced pill overdose five years previous in a New York City hotel. To her troubled mind, the forced pill overdose was a “mercy killing”, preserving the child from the inevitable horrors he was to suffer at the hands of an unseen, yet omnipresent, Satanic cult conspiracy.</p>
<p>Warning signs of Jordan’s dangerous state-of-mind had been clear for years. Jordan expressed deeply paranoid, irrational fears that the cult was actively tracking her every activity while ritually abusing Jude into a state of trauma-induced cognitive disability (he was, in fact, severely autistic).</p>
<div id="attachment_1070" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1967b210e87b887c9e2a1349ad2bf830.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1070" class="wp-image-1070 size-medium" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1967b210e87b887c9e2a1349ad2bf830-300x169.jpg" alt="1967b210e87b887c9e2a1349ad2bf830" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1967b210e87b887c9e2a1349ad2bf830-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1967b210e87b887c9e2a1349ad2bf830.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1070" class="wp-caption-text">Jude Michael Mirra</p></div>
<p>Many questioned what, if anything, was true in Jordan’s suspicious, delusional allegations. However, few questioned the competence of the therapists and other experts whom Jordan had consulted, who failed to recognize Jordan’s dangerously delusional state, failed to balance her fantastical beliefs with critical inquiries, and even apparently encouraged and cultivated her most deranged and deadly convictions. Oddly, even when reporting on the trial, journalists seemed entirely blind to evidence of professional incompetence, the influence that sanctioned pseudoscience seems to have played in Ms. Jordan’s destructive beliefs.<span id="more-1068"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>A Delusion of Conspiracy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Jordan contacted the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation in 2008 with a bizarre, sprawling and disjointed tale of Ritual Abuse and constant, unshakeable surveillance. She was detained, on an emergency basis, for a mental health evaluation. Jude was taken into custody. </span></p>
<p>“I couldn’t make sense of what she was saying,” special agent Bruce Dexter would later testify, “She was jumping around to different topics, different areas. It was a very convoluted story.”[1]</p>
<p>The stories Ms. Jordan would tell of her son’s suffering at the hands of a Satanic conspiracy were indeed convoluted. By her own telling, she never left the boy’s side, yet she would report that Jude communicated to her (not that she witnessed) that he had been made to receive electric shocks to his genitals, forced “to drink blood, kill animals and have sex with several babysitters and close relatives.”[2]</p>
<p>Before arriving in Wyoming, specifically for the purpose of reporting the Satanic cult crimes to the investigators, Jordan travelled with Jude to various locations across the nation, staying in hotels, relocating at a moment’s notice in an attempt to throw Jude’s pursuers from their trail. Having contacted the Wyoming office in advance, Ms. Jordan was met by Law Enforcement at the airport. Jude, the agents noted, was without socks or underwear on his person, nor did Jordan’s luggage contain any fresh clothes for the boy. The agents were further alarmed by the copious amounts of unlabeled medications Jordan carried for Jude’s seemingly ad hoc “treatment” regimen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical examination would yield “no evidence of sexual assault of any kind”[3].</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More discrediting to Jordan’s claims, however, was the fact that Jude, the alleged source of the abuse allegations, appeared to have very little verbal skills with which to communicate the allegations at all.</span></p>
<p>Against medical advice, Ms. Jordan was released “of her own recognizance” after her emergency mental health evaluation, following which the Court considered evidence indicating that Jordan presented an imminent danger to her son. Clearly not at all convinced of Ms. Jordan’s sanity, or Jude’s safety in her care, the Court also didn’t feel that the legal burden of evidence was met to justify placing Jude in foster care.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the time will come when recriminations are made saying somebody in authority should have seen this coming and acted to prevent it,” the District Court Judge in Wyoming stated presciently when remitting the child back to his mother’s care. “That&#8217;s what&#8217;s on everybody&#8217;s minds here. That&#8217;s the elephant in the room that nobody talks about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing “improper” criticisms directed toward those who failed to prevent the Virginia Tech mass shooting, perpetrated by an openly disturbed student, the Court preemptively apologized for Jude Michael Mirra’s murder, stating, “Our system doesn’t work that way. You don’t go arrest somebody because you’re afraid they might do something. Those are made after the fact looking back, and I think we’re dealing with a situation like that here.”[4]</p>
<p>Just under two years later, on February 03, 2010, Ms. Jordan checked into the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan with Jude, after hours of aimless cab rides throughout New York City. Late at night, while the boy slept, Jordan crushed about 20 Xanax pills and 40 Ambiens into a mixture of vodka and orange juice that she then forced down the 8-year old’s throat while sitting atop him “using enough force to bruise that boy on the face, the nose, the chest,” according to the prosecution.[5]</p>
<p>Media reporting on the case almost universally focused on the superficial narrative: the shocking tragedy of a millionaire mother, desperate and delusional, driven to the most unthinkable act of crime. Ms. Jordan had, some 20 years previous, started a successful home health care service upon which her affluence was built. The recriminations against “somebody in authority”, fearfully predicted by the Wyoming District Court, never manifested. Troublingly, nobody asked, following the murder, why Jordan’s dangerous mental state, so obvious to Law Enforcement untrained in Psychology, could have seemingly escaped the notice of the mental health care professionals whose services Ms. Jordan had retained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Facilitated Communication</b></p>
<p>Jude was 7 years old when Florida-based “trauma therapist” Carol Crow diagnosed him with Multiple Personality Disorder (more recently known as Dissociative Identity Disorder [DID]). It’s a diagnosis that is problematic even in ideal therapeutic settings, as the condition enjoys no scientific validation and is largely viewed as discredited. In Jude’s case, however, such a diagnosis is further complicated in that it was arrived at by analysis of the boy’s own self-reports &#8212; reports he was clearly unable to convey in reality, but that were manufactured in his name via “facilitated communication”.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitated Communication (FC) is defined by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oxford’s Dictionary of Psychology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “A teaching method and therapeutic technique in which facilitators or partners help people with severe developmental disabilities to communicate by providing sufficient manual guidance to enable them to convey messages through a keyboard, a picture board, or a speech synthesizer.” This method “often appears to reveal unexpected literacy and a far higher level of intellectual functioning than the person was believed to possess, but single-blind studies and double-blind studies have revealed that disabled people are unable to respond intelligently to stimuli that are unseen by their facilitators and that the facilitators unwittingly control the responses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 20 years ago, scientific debate concerning FC was already quite settled. In 1995, the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Psychologist</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published a paper titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A History of Facilitated Communication</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [7] noting that, “Controlled research using single and double blind procedures in laboratory and natural settings with a range of clinical populations with which FC is used have determined that, not only are the people with disabilities unable to respond accurately to label or describe stimuli unseen by their assistants, but that the responses are controlled by the assistants.” The authors were blunt in their conclusion: “FC is a pseudoscientific procedure serving antiscientific ends.”</span></p>
<p>Convinced that her child’s apparent autism was actually a grossly improbable psychophysiological response to traumatic sexual abuse, Ms. Jordan believed she could facilitate Jude’s articulate cries for help. Helping guide Jude’s hand over a computer keyboard or Blackberry device, Jordan would “assist” him in producing typed conversations. As one witness testified, a nurse and forensic interviewer attempted communication with Jude and determined that his alleged typed responses were fully attributable to Jordan, and “not at all in any way, shape, or form Jude.”</p>
<p>“[Jude] was, basically, very lethargic and not even looking or paying attention to what was going on, and Miss Jordan was guiding his hand on the buttons to push on the laptop computer.”[8]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Multiple Personality Disorder</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory behind Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now rebranded as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), is that some traumas, particularly childhood sexual traumas, are so horrific and incomprehensible that memories of their occurrence are “repressed”, relegated to some dark corner of the mind, outside of immediate consciousness where they develop new, alternate, or “alter” personalities of their own. Intuitive as this might now sound in a culture wherein this premise has served as a well-worn dramatic plot device, none of it stands up to scientific scrutiny. While proponents of DID theory currently like to claim that the condition lies somewhere on a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) spectrum, Dr. Richard McNally, Professor and Director of Clinical Training at Harvard University’s Department of Psychology, points out, “[t]he hallmark of PTSD is involuntary, intrusive recollection of traumatic experiences,” [9]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not selective, protective amnesia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while evidence for the existence of “repressed” traumas &#8212; often alleged to stem from long-term episodic extreme childhood abuse &#8212; is dubious at best, there is still no reliable evidence that DID even results from childhood trauma. [10] [11]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The “evidence” cited to support the claims of DID’s relationship to child abuse comes primarily from self reports of the DID-diagnosed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the memories of abuse have been “repressed”, how can one report upon something that they have entirely redacted from their minds? Often, hypnosis and other memory retrieval techniques are employed to draw forth what is presumed to be accessible in the subconscious mind. Unfortunately, this digging about for “repressed memories” can serve to create false memories that almost always conform to the assumptions held by the therapist. (With this in mind, Dr. Numan Gharaibeh, staff psychiatrist at Danbury Hospital, CT, suggests that “a DID diagnosis causes memories of childhood sexual abuse,” [12]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than the other way round.) False memories can be cultivated into deeply-held convictions, even when those memories are extremely bizarre and improbable. Hypnotism has been employed to “regress” subjects into “remembering” their own births, or even confabulated past lives. It is primarily recovered memory narratives that are responsible for the modern folklore of alien abduction. (“Abductees’” false memories, in fact, are measurably as traumatic as memories of real, corroborated traumas, which gives some idea of the gross, unforgivable incompetence that therapists employing suggestive memory retrieval techniques in search of childhood sexual abuse are party to.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) [13]</span></p>
<p>It was, in large part, the recovered memory testimonials of individuals being treated for Multiple Personality Disorder that sustained an embarrassing modern witch hunt known to sociologists today as the “Satanic Panic”. Spanning a period beginning in 1980 and declining into obscurity after the mid-90s, this bizarre moral uproar saw a temporary mainstreaming of hysterical conspiracist claims related to Satanic Ritual Abuse and cultic criminal networks secretly working toward the destruction of all societal moral order. Daytime talk show hosts, from Oprah Winfrey to Geraldo Rivera, regularly, and entirely uncritically, aired Satanic abuse “survivor” stories, despite a complete absence of corroborating evidence. It was a literal witch-hunt. Lives were ruined, families torn apart, decades of innocent lives wasted away in prison cells, and much of this, beyond any sensible doubt, was urged forward by incompetent therapists hypnotically probing their clients for revelations of repressed abuse.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The obvious parallel to the Salem witch trials has often been noted, but as one recent historical account points out, “[a]fter the panic died down in Salem, however, there were apologies and reparations,” [&#8230;] “[n]o such apologies followed [the Satanic Panic], and there hasn’t been much in the way of reparations either. [&#8230;] Of the many hundreds of people who were investigated [during the panic], some 190 were formally charged with crimes, leading to at least 83 convictions. Undoing these convictions proved to be a slow, halting, and very painful process.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [14] </span></p>
<p>Despite being thoroughly and completely discredited by law enforcement, scientists, and journalists, the conspiracy theory of Satanic Ritual Abuse as an intentional, DID-creating trauma-based mind-control program, still holds currency among certain professionals in mental health care, and many of the mental health professionals who were instrumental in fomenting panic in the 80s still hold strong to their methods and theories today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the <em>International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation</em> (ISSTD) is carefully presented as a scientifically sanctioned “professional association organized to develop and promote comprehensive, clinically effective and empirically based resources and responses to trauma and dissociation,” [15]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it remains the final, largest refuge for conspiracist mental health professionals still invested in DID theory and irrational, absurd, fully debunked notions of Satanic mind-control plots. [16]</span></p>
<p>While most of what the ISSTD publicly presents attempts to defend “recovered memories” and seeks to legitimate dissociative multipicity as a naturally-occurring response to trauma, the organization also maintains a “Ritual-Abuse/Mind-Control Special Interest Group (RA/MC SIG)” dedicated to furthering “dialogue, knowledge, research, and training on the etiology, evaluation, and effective treatment of trauma and dissociation in clients reporting histories of ritual abuse or mind control.” [17]</p>
<p>The first of three contacts listed for the ISSTD’s “RA/MC SIG” is one Ellen Lacter, a San Diego-based Clinical Psychologist with bizarre beliefs in Satanic conspiracies and government mind-control.</p>
<p>It was to Ellen Lacter that Gigi Jordan took Jude in search of validation for her delusional and paranoid fears. Unsurprisingly, it appears she found it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Ellen Lacter</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, Ellen Lacter filed a Suspected Child Abuse Report [18]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Child Welfare Services agency in Santa Barbara, California. The report was dated April 02, only one day after the Emergency Shelter Hearing had taken place. In the report, she stated:</span></p>
<p>“Gigi Jordan, mother of a boy, Jude Jordan (DOB: 07/13/2001), reports that Jude has recently (since early, 2008) disclosed to her that Emile Tzekov (Jude’s biological father who has relinquished his parental rights) abused him (Jude), including penetration, anal penetration (unknown if digital or penile), forced ingestion of feces, putting needles under his fingernails and in the webs between his fingers, choking him, and needle-pricking his chest and legs. Jude has suffered developmental delays and medical conditions that may be a direct effect of this alleged abuse.”</p>
<p>In a follow-up correspondence with the agency, Lacter noted, “The police questioned Ms. Jordan and did not believe her disclosures. They placed her on a 72-hour hold in Cheyenne Regional Medical Center Behavioral Unit, and placed her son with Family Services.” However, “the hospital released Ms. Jordan on her own recognizance prior to her scheduled hearing of 4/1/2008, apparently having assessed her as credible and sane.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, Ms. Jordan had been released against medical advice, nor was she adjudged either credible or sane. As shown above, the Court very explicitly expressed grave concern for Jude’s safety in his mother’s care, while explaining, seemingly apologetically, that they did not meet the legal burden necessary to take Jude from her custody. A psychologist and licensed forensic examiner who assessed Ms. Jordan stated at the hearing that Jordan seemed to hold “a fixated focus that presented itself as almost delusional that had a paranoid realm to it,” [19]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and he expressed concern for Ms. Jordan’s degeneration into a “full-blown delusional system with paranoid ideation.” [20]</span></p>
<p>Ms. Lacter, however, seemed to see none of Ms. Jordan’s apparently obvious delusional paranoia, even as Ms. Jordan spoke of an omnipresent Satanic cult conspiracy. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Lacter explained in her report, “Ms. Jordan first contacted me, having found me through my website on ritual abuse (www.endritualabuse.org), concerned that ritual abuse might explain her son’s behaviors and the disclosures he had begun to make, Jude’s behaviors and disclosures, reported by Ms. Jordan, were consistent with that of other victims of ritual abuse. Ms. Jordan retained me to provide her with consultation to help her to keep her son safe and to help him psychologically.”</p>

<p>A look at Ellen Lacter’s website clearly reveals that she would be the last person to disabuse anybody of paranoid delusions related to Satanic conspiracies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the homepage of endritualabuse.org, one finds a wealth of information related to “mind control”, “ritual abuse”, Satanic cults and “Witchcraft Abuse”. Her recommended reading list contains such heady titles as, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Altars: Roots and Realities of Cultic and Satanic Ritual Abuse and Multiple Personality Disorder; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and apocalyptic titles such as, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mind Control, World Control</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her site also includes instructions for ordering a book titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for the Memories, The Truth Has Set Me Free</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Brice Taylor, one of the most outrageous tales of conspiracist delusion ever penned. Both Ellen Lacter and Brice Taylor have presented at annual conferences for an organization known as S.M.A.R.T. (Stop Mind-control And Ritual abuse Today). S.M.A.R.T. conferences discus such pressing current mental health issues as dissociative disorders brought on by Freemason, Illuminati, and Satanist ritual abuse activities, as well as government mind-control plots. When I attended a S.M.A.R.T. conference in 2009, I noted a sales booth offering a “more advanced species of tinfoil hat,” [21]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> baseball caps lined with a metallic fiber weave meant to block electromagnetic transmissions. I also observed a speaker by the name of “Royal”, at all of about forty years of age claim that she was a personal slave to nazi doctor Josef Mengele.</span></p>
<p>“My experience with Mengele”, Royal explained in a lecture (the gist of which was that Satan uses abortion as a means of traumatic mind-control), “involved much of the trauma-based mind control involving core programming (such as End-Time programming) that is connected to the global take over. He used the Psychic/Spiritual dimensions using, what I have come to call ‘demonic harmonics’, which involves using musical tones and quantum physics to open up portals into the spiritual realms. I also have core programs set up that were created using abortions as a means to develop them and more.” (It’s also worth noting that a current member the ISSTD’s Board of Directors, Adah Sachs, was presenting at this carnival of lunacy.) [22]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for the Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Brice Taylor claims to have recovered memories, following an automobile accident, which revealed to her a hidden past of government mind-control in which she was programmed to act as a sex slave for distinguished people of power. According to Taylor, the late comedian Bob Hope acted as her primary keeper during her enslavement, in which time she was made to provide carnal comforts to world leaders and famous entertainers, from Elvis Presley to Neil Diamond. Among Taylor’s rambling list of absurd claims is the charge that she was made to participate in the filming of dolphin porn directed by Sylvester Stallone, for the amusement of then-president Ronald Reagan:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Another auxiliary project, one that brought in proceeds, was dolphin pornography. Dolphin porn was filmed in Malibu and in the dolphin tanks at Point Mugu. It was convenient because they had cages already built and so the dolphins could be housed there for use almost anytime. [Ronald] Reagan really loved the dolphin stuff. He watched a porn video of [my daughter] Kelly and I with a couple of dolphins. During the viewing he smiled, patted my leg and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be with you later.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t into sex with children and didn&#8217;t have sex with my daughter. When the film was over he said, &#8220;Watching you do underwater ballet is beautiful, but seeing you with the dolphin is out of this world!&#8221; He laughed and looked up, like he was seeing a missile or shuttle launch. Lots of dolphin porn was filmed. I believe Bob [Hope] gave copies of it to Prince Charles, Prince Phillip and Margaret Thatcher, who is a lesbian.&#8221; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if one were to conclude that Ms. Lacter were a New World Order conspiracist, she points out, in one interview, that she doesn’t believe in the lunatic theory of some single, all-powerful force of evil conspiring to rule the world: “I believe that there are a number of different organized groups that all have the agenda of ruling the world. There’s the Satanic network, and I don’t believe that that is all networked, there’s the witchcraft network,” etc. [24]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In fact, “They” are everywhere, and they are all masters of trauma-based mind-control. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Taylor_Brice_-_Thanks_for_the_memories.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1069" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Taylor_Brice_-_Thanks_for_the_memories-193x300.jpg" alt="Taylor_Brice_-_Thanks_for_the_memories" width="193" height="300" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Taylor_Brice_-_Thanks_for_the_memories-193x300.jpg 193w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Taylor_Brice_-_Thanks_for_the_memories.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" /></a>By Lacter’s reckoning, “there&#8217;s probably well over a thousand children being abused horribly in cult practices here [in San Diego] and I don&#8217;t think San Diego is worse than any place else.” [25]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, these cults revel in infant sacrifice, sometimes going after babies that are in utero to satiate their bloodlust: “[&#8230;] they&#8217;ll force the delivery early so seven or eight months gestation and that baby will be sacrificed and then that person will be programmed [by way of mind-control] to believe that she just had a miscarriage,” [26]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> however, Lacter continues, “a lot of the children who are sacrificed in rituals are brought in from third world countries.” This, apparently, explains the lack of evidential corroboration for Lacter’s outsized claims of ritual sacrifice activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there is no credible evidence for Lacter’s claims at all, only the “recovered memories” of mistreated clients in DID therapy, and the lunatic claims of her associates, like Brice Taylor. But the absence of evidence, according to Lacter’s extremely deluded narrative, is merely evidence of the insidious power these cults wield. Having established themselves at every level of society, They secretly manipulate the unwitting public to prevent the truth of their existence from surfacing: “Most of the perpetrators of the most organized abuse never get arrested and they raise their kids to have jobs in law enforcement. They raise their kids to have jobs in child protective services and the District Attorney&#8217;s offices, etc. So they have their own network established in the institutions to erase records to disbelieve these reports. They have a very organized never-let-it-come-out campaign.” [27]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Naturally, the media has been infiltrated as well: “The most organized groups have raised some of their children to be reporters who definitely write articles saying none of this is true, these therapists are crazy, these survivors are victims of their therapists putting memories in their minds. So the media is very influential and is one of their main ways of keeping the truth from being exposed.” [28]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perusing Lacter’s material, one gets the distinct sense that she has never been approached with a claim too deranged or schizophrenic for her to doubt the teller’s sanity: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ritualistically abused children and adults are usually misdiagnosed for years as psychotic and delusional, due to their reports of hearing voices and extreme state of fear. The voices belong to dissociated personalities and to spirits and demons they perceive as having been attached to them during ritual ceremonies.”</span></p>
<p>This is the therapist that Gigi Jordan sought for consultation when apparently at the height of her paranoid delusions of Satanic cult persecution; Ellen Lacter, who, acting under licensed professional mental health sanction, purveys conspiracist notions to the potentially mentally vulnerable. Had Gigi Jordan put her trust into a sane, rational, mental health professional at this critical time in this tragic story, perhaps Jude might still be alive today.</p>
<p>And it gets worse, the shame upon the mental health profession is more profound still; Ellen Lacter can occasionally be found speaking at professional conferences for mental health professionals in which her convoluted conspiracism enjoys peer acceptance. She is but one in a fringe community of therapists, social workers, and counselors, who presume to see evidence of Satanic mind-control in their susceptible clients. It is not uncommon that such conspiracy-based conferences, purveying theories of Satanic abuse, government mind-control, and recovered memory therapies, offer Continuing Education Units to licensed attendees in the field of mental health care.</p>
<p>Lacter is very guarded about her practice, and she did not reply to my inquiries regarding the services she provided in keeping Jude “safe” and “helping him psychologically.” It is my contention, however, that the very licensure of one as flagrantly deranged, mentally incompetent, and in obvious need of psychiatric care as Ellen Lacter is herself, is indicative of a system of mental health care that is in desperate need of massive reform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Frank Putnam</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A psychologist and licensed forensic examiner for district court at United Medical Center Behavioral Health Services testifying at the 2008 Emergency Shelter Hearing described the Facilitated Communication Jordan used with Jude. “I guess [Jude] has an arm that is somewhat flaccid, and [Jordan] was able to [facilitate his typing], and he was able to point to certain things on the keyboard, and she was able to piece together some potential [responses].” [29]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A doctor from a Children’s Clinic who examined Jude in 2008 didn’t equivocate when asked whether or not Jude was capable of cohering the complex thoughts required in relaying the narrative of sadistic Satanic abuse being attributed to him: “No. He cannot respond to direct questions.” [30]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p>During the 2014 trial of Gigi Jordan for the murder of Jude, prosecutors also pointed to the extreme unlikelihood that an 8-year old boy (much less an autistic boy with communication deficiencies) could possibly possess the vocabulary and spelling abilities that were present in his alleged communiques; words like “aggressively” and “sadistic”. [31]</p>
<p>There was, in fact, no question at all that “Jude’s” statements, including the narrative of victimization at the hands of a Satanic cult conspiracy, were derived from Facilitated Communication. Nonetheless, an expert witness for the defense, Frank Putnam, MD, a Professor of Pediatrics and Child Psychiatry from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center,</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, submitted an Expert Witness Report to Jordan’s counsel that directly contradicted the established facts. According to Putnam, “There are a number of statements in therapists’ records and affidavits attesting to the witnessing of Jude’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">independent</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use of a texting device to communicate with others.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [32][Emphasis added]</span></p>
<p>In an appearance on the Dr. Phil Show, Putnam went further. “Jude was able to communicate what had happened to him using the texting. I’ve seen this kind of texting with a number of children now. I’m quite struck. Even though they may not be able to speak and many people assume they must be in some ways mentally retarded or challenged that they often can text at very high levels of language.” [33]</p>
<p>But what exactly is Putnam talking about? What does he mean when he refers to “this kind of texting”? Is he referring to “facilitated” texting and, if so, why does he claim Jude could text independently? And why is it that Putnam failed to mention the element of Facilitated Communication at all? Does he deny that FC was being used at all, or is he claiming that there were occasional instances of independent texting?</p>
<p>I asked Dr. Putnam some time ago, via email, if he could elaborate upon his comments related to Jude’s alleged independent typing, but he never replied. I also posed another poignant line of inquiry within the same email asking if he didn’t feel that Ms. Jordan’s “perception that her son was being abused by a Satanic conspiracy helped motivate her to kill him?” And, if so, “would it not be accurate to say that a medical professional who failed to realize and relay to Ms. Jordan that her perception of her communication with her son was inaccurate (and thus allowed her to create a delusion of Satanic abuse allegations) is complicit (by way of incompetence) in the murder itself?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Putnam could only be considered something of an accessory after the fact, as he provided his mystifying analysis of Jude’s alleged communications after the murder took place. But, if Putnam was looking to obfuscate the facts of the crime, he was likely at least as motivated to defend the diagnosis of DID and its narrative of extreme abuse as he was motivated to keep Jordan out of prison. In his report, Putnam describes himself as an “authority on child and adolescent dissociative disorders,” and under “professional organizations” on his CV, we see listed the ISSTD. Putnam was the ISSTD’s recipient of their annual Cornelia Wilbur award in 1990 “for outstanding clinical contributions to the treatment of dissociative disorders.” (Cornelia Wilbur was the psychiatrist who we now know conspired to manufacture a false narrative of Multiple Personality Disorder for her famed client known as “Sybil”.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) [34] In 2013, Putnam was recipient of the ISSTD’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no physical medical evidence to support the claims of Jude’s sadistic sufferings, Putnam attempted to match the self-reports allegedly typed by Jude to possible psychological symptoms of traumatic abuse. This necessitated that Putnam both reject Jude’s diagnosis of autism &#8212; attributing his cognitive difficulties instead to psychological trauma &#8212; and accepting the alleged self-reports attributed to Jude as legitimate communications from the boy. In rejecting the autism diagnosis, Putnam pointed to atypical features in Jude’s autism symptoms concluding, “it is highly probable that some of Jude’s unexplained and unusual medical problems were unrecognized injuries from physical and sexual abuse.” However, as another doctor noted, in recognition of Jude’s positive response to steroid treatments, “most cases of autism are not immune-mediated. There are however, rare cases of autism, variants of autism that are immune-mediated.” [35]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jude, it seemed, was one of those cases, nor could any idiosyncrasies in Jude’s symptoms change the unlikelihood that he’d suffered the tortures claimed, for which he remained physically un-scarred.</span></p>
<p>Apparently desperate for at least the appearance of some type of physical corroboration to support the extreme abuse claims, Putnam embarrassingly noted dental abscesses Jude had received treatment for in 2004, stating that they “could well have been the result of being made to eat feces, an abuse Jude that [sic] reported to several individuals [&#8230;]”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>A Need for Reform</b></p>
<p>Another regular ISSTD annual conference presenter, Bessel van der Kolk, submitted expert testimony intended to describe how trauma could manifest itself in ways that could look like autism. The court excluded his testimony, but there is a certain audacity to a man like van der Kolk submitting expert testimony at all. Back in 1996, while being deposed as an expert, defending recovered memory veracity and legitimacy, van der Kolk’s testimony was excluded after attorney Christopher Barden revealed severe problems in a research paper van der Kolk used to support his position. A graduate student, who had collected van der Kolk’s data, had been expelled for scientific dishonesty in falsifying data. Merely removing the student’s name from the list of co-authors, van der Kolk’s paper remained otherwise unrevised.</p>
<p>However, as Barden pointed out,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The questions that eliminated van der Kolk were not so much questions about his old researchers or testimony in the Hungerford case but rather his shocking ignorance of his own profession. It is amazing to me that van der Kolk had been deposed and cross examined by dozens of lawyers over many years and not one ever asked him to specify the limitations on the testimony of experts included in the AMA and ethics codes. Not one lawyer ever asked him to discuss the differences between the concepts of reliability and validity. Not one lawyer asked him to discuss the actuarial prediction vs. clinical prediction research. Not one lawyer assessed his knowledge of testing, psychological measurement, the cross-cultural history of &#8220;dissociative phenomena&#8221; or other relevant matters (note for example, van der Kolk&#8217;s stunning errors in discussing Greek literature). Not one of these attorneys engaged him in a dialogue about his own research methods including how he assessed the reliability and validity of his own measures and procedures. Not one of these attorneys apparently asked him about the Coping and Resiliency research literatures and not one even discovered that his old mentor was Bruno Bettleheim &#8212; new believed to be one of the great frauds in psychology in the 20th Century. Van der Kolk&#8217;s failure to answer these basic and critical professional questions about science, methodology and history doomed his credibility as an &#8220;expert&#8221; in this field and he knew it the moment those questions were asked.” [36]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is exasperatingly disappointing that in all this time nothing has changed. Harmful and discredited theories are being put forward by the same unwavering individuals, to the detriment of mental health care consumers, to the detriment of the mental health care profession, and with occasional tragic consequences. Indeed, given the consensus among scientists, it would appear that only a “shocking ignorance” of advances in memory research and cognitive science could account for the dogged persistence of discredited DID therapies and repressed memory retrieval techniques. It is an outrage that a pseudoscience-based organization such as the ISSTD (much less an organization like S.M.A.R.T.) can offer Continuing Education Units while propagating conspiracy theory. Fully debunked by empirical studies, the use of Facilitated Communication by a licensed therapist to arrive at a psychiatric diagnosis should, at the very least, cause for revocation of professional licensure. Obvious public displays of paranoid delusion, such as those expressed by Ellen Lacter, should, at the very least, cause for revocation of professional licensure and mandatory psychiatric evaluation. The fact that Ms. Jordan, harboring paranoid delusions, could have her delusions supported and affirmed by licensed mental health professional is a monstrous mental health scandal.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The facts are these: an 8-year old autistic boy was diagnosed with a debunked psychiatric disorder. The diagnosis was arrived at by discredited methods. The professional pseudoscientific assumptions surrounding the boy’s “treatment” likely contributed to paranoid delusions in his openly disturbed mother, who ultimately killed the boy in order to spare him from the horrors of a nonexistent threat. While the boy’s mother now serves a prison term for her crime, the worse-than-incompetent “professionals” who not only failed to prevent her from committing the murder, but may have actively fed the paranoid delusions that acted as her rationale for the deed, remain unapologetic and without censure. It is my contention that proper professional mental health intervention may well have prevented this woman from murdering her son. The fact that her filicidal delusions could be reinforced by mental health professionals should be cause for outrage and reform.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">To be fair &#8212; when considering the “expert” qualifications of the perpetually panic-stricken Dr. Randy Noblitt &#8212; one should take into consideration that the man’s doctoral thesis was, in fact, a work of Astrology. However, in a career made notable for unsubstantiated hysterical claims involving a preternatural conspiracy of Satan’s minions, his dissertation upon the <em>Celestial Concomitants of Human Behavior</em> may possibly be the most lucid work in Dr. Noblitt’s unquestionably disreputable bibliography.<a href="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mammoth-thing-Mind-Control.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1013 alignright" alt="Mammoth thing Mind Control" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mammoth-thing-Mind-Control-198x300.jpg" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mammoth-thing-Mind-Control-198x300.jpg 198w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mammoth-thing-Mind-Control.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a></p>
<p>I feel it important to make note of his dubious beginnings so one might recognize that this tin-foil hat Torquemada never, at any point in his professional career, seems to have become unhinged&#8230; he never exhibited a firm grasp of reality to begin with. Thus, when reading the barrage of lunacy attributed to “Little Knob” below, the question isn’t: <em>where did this professor of Clinical Psychology at Alliant University go wrong?</em>, instead, the question should be: <em>how is it that this man ever became a professor of Clinical Psychology at all?</em> And, worse,<em> How is it that his testimony, as a man of Science, was considered favorably in a situation where personal liberties were at stake?</em></p>
<p>In 1992, at the height of a social hysteria now commonly referred to as “the Satanic Panic”, Dr. Noblitt &#8212; believing he could disentangle the coercive subliminal sounds of secret demonic code within popular music, as well as decrypt the hidden meanings behind seemingly mundane occurrences &#8212; testified for the prosecution, as an “expert” in the field of “ritual abuse”, against one Fran and Dan Keller, a couple accused of engaging in child abuse at their home-based day care center. With no physical evidence to support the accusations (which included claims of graveyard rituals and medically undetected limb transplants) the couple was convicted on the most dubious of testimony. The children themselves &#8212; ignored when they claimed they were not abused at all (as happened even in testimony) &#8212; were led by coercive and incompetent interrogations to produce claims of abuse which are nearly impossible to credit [see footage and analysis of one such interrogation embedded below]. Noblitt’s own fantastical testimony, of course, was no more credible than Noblitt himself.<span id="more-1012"></span></p>
<p>21 years later, the Kellers still sit in prison, their case on appeal.</p>
<p>Dr. Evan Harrington, Associate Professor at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, wrote the below letter [following the embedded videos] &#8212; on behalf of the Kellers’ recent appeal &#8212; to the 14th District Court in Travis County, Texas, outlining the absurdities, shoddy methods, and scientific ignorance demonstrated by Dr. Randy Noblitt, concluding, “His opinions have been scientifically discredited, and are not shared by the vast majority of clinicians and researchers within the field of psychology.” The letter, bearing signatures of support from various esteemed social and behavioral scientists, reveals a disturbing portrait of Dr. Noblitt as a delusional man obstinately oblivious to any and all facts that serve to disconfirm his paranoid theories. The letter is a damning indictment against the institutions that would recognize such a clearly problematic character for an “expert”. The letter further raises grave doubts regarding the credibility of Alliant University, where Dr. Noblitt serves on faculty, still purveying the irrational narrative of a long discredited, thoroughly debunked hysteria.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">***********************************</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In Regards to the Expert Witness Testimony and Qualifications of Randy Noblitt, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Evan Harrington, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p> Dr. Randy Noblitt’s expert testimony was instrumental in securing the convictions of Fran and Dan Keller at their criminal trial in 1992. Specifically, Dr. Noblitt gave credence and claimed empirical support for the children’s involvement in such hard-to-hide activities as murders and dismemberments, grave robbing, airplane flights, and kidnappings. Dr. Noblitt testified that these were typical behaviors associated with so-called cult ritual abuse. With the promise of empirical support, Noblitt’s expert testimony encouraged jurors to believe the accusations despite the many outlandish elements associated with the actual charges.</p>
<p>The signers of this document present the court with evidence that Randy Noblitt, Ph.D. is not qualified to serve as an expert on the topic of “ritual abuse” or recovered memories and that such testimony lacked any empirical support at that time. This Letter to the Court has been written with the intent of illustrating the reasons why Dr. Noblitt is not qualified. Certainly, the points made below illustrate that it is highly unlikely that any court in the country would today permit Dr. Noblitt to testify today on the topic of “ritual abuse.”</p>
<p><strong>1. The Scientific Status of Theories of Satanic Ritual Abuse.</strong> At this point in time, and even in 1992, virtually no mainstream psychologists would accept the theories of ritual abuse that Dr. Noblitt puts forward.</p>
<p>At trial, Dr. Noblitt testified about the existence of cults using ritual abuse and of organized satanic networks engaged in wide-ranging criminal enterprises including child abuse. The picture painted by Dr. Noblitt in his testimony at trial is one where criminal cults are common across the United States, and that these alleged cults typically engage in torture and murder of both adults and children. Furthermore, Dr. Noblitt opined that these cults are experts in a form of mind control or brainwashing in which victims are so heavily traumatized that they develop total and complete amnesia until the victim enters therapy and recovers the memory. His descriptions of these cults involved rape, murder, torture, grave robbing, and ceremonial animal and human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he alleged that these activities took place at churches, involved police officers and other professional individuals. Lurid media coverage of this issue at the time additionally invoked the specter of widespread cannibalism. In order to explain the lack of physical evidence for these outrageous crimes, Dr. Noblitt explained to the jury that these cults will frequently lead their victims to believe in something preposterous, so that if they ever told of their tortures the stories would involve elements that would be so far-fetched that the victims would necessarily be disbelieved. This, according to Dr. Noblitt, was done intentionally by the cults as part of the mind control programming in order to discredit their victims.</p>
<p>In an interview shortly after the trial in a local newspaper, Dr. Noblitt was described as having been the prosecution expert witness in many ritual abuse cases, including the Keller case (Dickinson, 1993). He stated in that interview that Dan Keller, while in court, used a mysterious hand signal to mind-control people within the courtroom. Further, he asserted that cults use severe torture on victims and that all memory of the torture is repressed. In a direct quote from this news article, Dr. Noblitt stated: “I believe they use a technique of mind control unknown in legitimate psychology. It’s akin to hypnosis, created through abuse…the state of shock is so severe that it sends the victim into a deep trance state. Then cult members use different signals or triggers…” to control the victims.</p>
<p>In his 1995 book, Dr. Noblitt went into more detail regarding Dan Keller’s mysterious hand signal: A reporter had given Dr. Noblitt a videotape of Mr. Keller appearing in court, where Mr. Keller appeared to hold his fingers briefly in the form of a letter “C”. When interviewed by the reporter, Dr. Noblitt opined for the television audience that Mr. Keller had attempted to use mind control in the courtroom in an attempt at jury nullification, just in case any secret Satanists were on jury (see Noblitt &amp; Perskin, 1995, pp. 150-152). Relatedly, in 1996 I heard Dr. Noblitt speak at another conference. In his presentation, Dr. Noblitt stated that he uses the MMPI test to diagnose ritual abuse (the MMPI is a standardized test that has never been approved for this use), and stated that in his clinical practice he has uncovered “secret cult handshakes” and that he uses these special handshakes with his patients in order to “access” buried cult-mind-control-programming. He uses the information gleaned in this way as evidence for the existence of ritual abuse cults. Furthermore, he stated that he “strokes people’s faces to access the ritual abuse victim’s [memories] and make them dissociate”. At this point, he said, “if they give you a different name, this is scientific evidence for dissociation.” In summary, the world portrayed by Dr. Noblitt is one in which thousands of cult abusers have infiltrated respectable society, and specifically daycare centers, in order to operate a clandestine subculture engaged in massive levels of felonious criminality, all based on mind control triggered by secret handshakes and hand signals.</p>
<p>To be clear, at the time of the trial the hypothesis outlined above was considered to be a fringe belief held by a small number of clinicians, who believed these things solely because of the statements of their patients – not because of any physical evidence that had surfaced. By the time of the trial there had been highly skeptical journalistic essays about ritual abuse (e.g., Nathan, 1990,1991; Rabinowitz, 1990), criminologists had written articles debunking the ritual abuse hypothesis (e.g., Jenkins &amp; Maier-Katkin, 1991), social anthropologists had traced causal pathways explaining the issue as a social panic purveyed by moral entrepreneurs (e.g., Mulhern, 1991; Victor, 1991). In summary, outside of a small band of psychologists interested in multiple personality disorder, the field of psychology was at that time generally dismissive of claims of ritual abuse.</p>
<p>Prior to 1992, psychologists had offered skeptical accounts of certain types of memory claims, and certainly had offered viable <em>alternative explanations</em> of memory errors that could explain ritual abuse allegations. The breadth of coverage by experimental psychologists is beyond the scope of this Letter, but it is fair to say that by 1992 a substantial body of published research existed regarding errors in adult memory (e.g., Loftus &amp; Ketchum, 1991) and with regard to the suggestibility of children (e.g., Ceci, Ross, &amp; Toglia, 1987; Ceci, Toglia, &amp; Ross, 1990).</p>
<p>In a study I recently conducted (Harrington, Stone, &amp; Guss, 2011), I collected a sample of 118 abnormal psychology textbooks spanning the years 1886 to 2011. Abnormal psychology textbooks are very useful in gauging the level of acceptance within the field of psychology for any issue related to mental health, and they serve as a training instrument which all new members of the profession must be exposed to within their required college courses. This sample of textbooks included 29 texts dating from 1980 (the beginning of the ritual abuse panic) to 1992 (the time of the Keller trial). Of these 29 texts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not one</span> contained a reference to ritual abuse. In contrast, all of the texts covered the topic of multiple personality, and 97% covered the topic of child sexual abuse. This definitively illustrates the fact that “ritual abuse” or “satanic ritual abuse” was NOT accepted within the mainstream psychological community at the time of the trial of Fran and Dan Keller. Had it been accepted, it would have been covered in abnormal psychology textbooks.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at the time of the trial the 43-page report on ritual abuse by FBI Special Agent Kenneth Lanning was available, having been released in January, 1992 (see also Lanning, 1989, 1991). Lanning, a member of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI, served as a consultant in numerous cases of alleged ritual abuse. The “Lanning Report” described his detailed review of hundreds of such cases. The cases described by Lanning involved human sacrifices and cannibalism, and seemed to come directly from Dr. Noblitt’s repertoire of ritual cult concepts. As Lanning described it, believers in the ritual cult hypothesis asserted that satanic ritual cults murder some 50,000 people each year in the United States, yet leave no evidence of the crimes because of their advanced expertise and organizational skills. However, unlike Noblitt, Lanning ultimately concluded that there was no legal-level evidence for the alleged ritual cult abuse claims. Lanning suggested that it is up to the mental health community to determine why these individuals believe in things that have not happened. As Lanning stated: “For at least eight years American law enforcement has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims of ritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of their allegations that deals with large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies. Now it is up to mental health professionals, not law enforcement, to explain why victims are alleging things that don’t seem to have happened” (Lanning, 1992, January, p. 40). Lanning’s conclusions were widely available within the field at the time, as they were published in multiple locations, including the journal <em>Child Abuse &amp; Neglect</em>. Any psychologist interested in the topic of ritual abuse at the time of the Keller trial would have been aware of Special Agent Lanning’s failure to find any corroboration for ritual abuse claims. An explanation for Dr. Noblitt’s failure to reference this important work in his trial testimony perhaps stems from the fact that believers in satanic ritual abuse had concluded that FBI Special Agent Lanning was himself a satanic high priest (Bottoms &amp; Davis, 1997; Lanning, 1992), in part because the report had a red cover.</p>
<p>In light of the critiques regarding ritual abuse accusations that were available in 1992, coming from multiple disciplines (including law enforcement), and in light of the lack of general acceptance within the field of psychology proper (as shown by the total absence of the topic in abnormal psychology textbooks), it is bewildering why Dr. Noblitt opined at trial that there was little controversy regarding ritual abuse (p. 147 of his testimony).</p>
<p>Further, at pages 158-159 of his testimony, Dr. Noblitt described attending a conference where most attendees raised their hands in belief at the existence of ritual abuse, which he used as evidence of general acceptance of his ideas. The problem with this scenario is that the conference described by Dr. Noblitt was one that specialized on the very issue he was polling. A similar result could be obtained if a political pollster went to a rally for candidate X and asked how many people supported candidate X – it would not be surprising if everyone raised their hands, and an honest pollster would refrain from using this as evidence that the majority of eligible voters also supported candidate X.</p>
<p>Another area of knowledge that was available at the time of the Keller’s 1992 trial involved the relationship of multiple personality disorder and ritualistic abuse. For example, Nicholas Spanos (1996), a highly respected researcher in the field of hypnosis and memory, argued strenuously that multiple personality was a social construction, and that claims of satanic ritual abuse could be entirely explained through the ordinary mechanisms of social influence and cognitive psychology. Much of the research cited Spanos was available in journal articles prior to 1992. His book lists 74 published articles where he was first author; 58 of these articles were available before 1992, and this body of research clearly called into question the veracity of claims of multiple personality, demon possession, hypnotism, and ritual abuse as well as providing a plausible alternative explanation for these wild claims.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Noblitt stated in testimony at trial that there is little controversy about his descriptions of ritual abuse. This statement was not factually true in 1992, and is less true today. Dr. Noblitt’s expert testimony did not represent any type of consensus within the field of psychology, but rather represented a fringe group of therapists who specialized in treating patients who believed they had been ritually abused. This is reflected in a survey that was conducted contemporaneously with the trial, but which was not published until later (Bottoms &amp; Davis, 1997; Bottoms, Shaver, &amp; Goodman, 1996), in which the researchers surveyed clinicians who were members of the American Psychological Association regarding clinical experiences with patients who believed they had experienced ritual abuse. Only 13% of the sample had “seen” an adult case of ritual abuse, but a far more telling statistic was that the overwhelming majority of ritual abuse cases were seen by only 2% of their respondents, who averaged hundreds of such cases. When asked about actual evidence in any of their clients’ cases, in only a handful of cases did the clinicians report that evidence existed to support the allegations, and in these instances the “evidence” was “usually ‘scars’…one respondent wrote ‘scars on right hand’” (Bottoms, Shaver, &amp; Goodman, 1996, p.23). The authors of this study concluded that a small minority of therapists were involved in massive numbers of ritual abuse cases, and that there was an overwhelming lack of evidence to support these claims. These data strongly support the view that, in the early 1990s, although psychologists tended to believe their clients’ ritual abuse claims when they encountered them, psychologists’ activities in treating ritual abuse was relegated to a fringe, and that therapists’ belief in ritual abuse was based primarily on stories provided by patients in therapy.</p>
<p>In order to provide additional evidence about the unscientific and unaccepted views of Dr. Noblitt, I described a conference hosted by Noblitt in 1995 (see Harrington, 1996) for a full description. This article has been submitted in full to the court by Keith S. Hampton, Esq. The conference took place in March, 1995, and I attended this conference as a participant observer in order to learn about the beliefs of the individuals within the ritual abuse psychotherapeutic community.</p>
<p>The major impression after leaving the conference was that the entire event is best characterized as having been anti-scientific. Normally, at academic conferences, presenters give different views about issues and provide data, which are interpreted. In the behavioral sciences, this is accomplished through experimentation and debate over the meanings of results of those experiments. The scientific enterprise proceeds largely through attempts to discredit hypotheses (see, e.g., <em>Daubert v Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals</em>, 1993), and in this way we see which hypotheses can withstand the test of skeptical scrutiny. Then, with sufficient replication and variation in tests and methods, a hypothesis or theoretical perspective may be endorsed by the relevant scientific community at large. Much of this scaffold of the scientific enterprise was described by Karl Popper in <em>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</em>, which dates to 1935. In spite of epistemological differences between philosophers, this outline has remained quite useful, and forms a portion of the logic behind the Daubert ruling. Contrary to this scientific approach, the milieu at the conference hosted by Dr. Noblitt can best be described as paranoid and anti-scientific. At no point did the conference presenters attempt to seriously engage with their critics, but rather they simply resorted to ad hominem attacks on all who disagreed with the ritual abuse perspective. Dr. Noblitt went to great lengths to accommodate the holocaust deniers, representatives of the American militia movement, and charlatans who claimed that they had been mind-controlled (as described in the self-published books they were selling). However, at no point during this entire conference was there any effort to critically and scientifically address the very real and very numerous criticisms of the ritual abuse hypothesis that had accumulated by 1995. All manner of preposterous claims regarding ritual abuse were permitted, and any skepticism, no matter how bland, was met with a clearly aggressive social response (see my 1996 article for details). Far from being a scientific conference, this was a conference at which zealots and true believers pushed their views on others. To me, the most disturbing aspect was certainly the fact that mental health patients were encouraged to attend and learn of the threat posed by satanic ritual cults, cults that were in fact nonexistent.</p>
<p><strong>2. Since 1992, there is an enormous scientific literature to explore the generation of beliefs and statements about ritualistic abuse.</strong> In the intervening years, literally hundreds of professional journal articles and books have been published either criticizing the ritual abuse hypothesis (as exemplified by Dr. Noblitt), or exploring how false memories may be generated in adults and children. It is fair to say that at the current time, belief in ritual abuse within the psychological community is at an all-time low. Abnormal psychology textbooks today sometimes cover the topic, but they do so in a skeptical light as an example of false memory (e.g., Alloy, Riskind, &amp; Manos, 2005, who incredulously described a woman who alleged attending 850 satanic ceremonies involving crimes such as infanticide). The research by highly regarded psychologists Gail Goodman and Bette Bottoms was instrumental in stemming the satanic panic within the professional psychological community. After conducting several surveys, which were funded by a grant from the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, their research team concluded that religion-related abuse (such as deprivation of medication on religious grounds, or injury during exorcism) was an important issue for society to face (Bottoms, Shaver, &amp; Goodman, 1996), but that virtually no legal-standard evidence existed for claims of ritual abuse, and such claims were likely the result of false memories (Bottoms &amp; Davis, 1997). Furthermore, Bottoms and Davis (1997) argued that conferences (of the type hosted by Dr. Noblitt) were a likely vector or pathway in the genesis of these false memories (cf., Mulhern, 1991). At the time, the research team was considered impartial in the sense that they had no stake in the ritual abuse controversy and they had extensive experience in research on child abuse.</p>
<p>Other very notable scientists have also critiqued the concept of ritualistic abuse, by presenting empirical evidence. For example, Harvard psychologist Richard McNally opines that the evidence that some people develop false memories is overwhelming, and “the strongest evidence comes from the strange saga of satanic ritual abuse” (2003, p. 259), which he also describes as “extravagant” (p. 258). The work of Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist at UC Irvine, is equally impressive. Rather than exploring the quality of memories of traumatized individuals as McNally does, Loftus produces in the laboratory false memories in her participants for a variety of life events, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some of which are highly incredible</span>. A number of developmental psychologists (e.g., Bruck &amp; Ceci, 1995; Poole &amp; Lindsay, 1995) have shown how commonly-used interview techniques can bring children to make very bizarre statements that sometimes seem ritualistic in nature. In conclusion, it is fair to say that the scientific psychological community today does not endorse the types of beliefs about ritual abuse expressed by Dr. Noblitt.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Dr. Noblitt’s belief in ritualistic abuse continues into the 21st Century.</strong> Dr. Noblitt’s staunch beliefs expressed in 1992 were not abated by the tide of history and science. This reflects the possibly that his testimony was based on an unchangeable belief that was immune to arguments of logic and science. This does not make for a reliable expert witness.</p>
<p>In an article written by Noblitt, dated 2007, located on an internet web site (http://ritualabuse.us/ritualabuse/articles/an-empirical-look-at-the-ritual-abuse-controversy-randynoblitt-phd/) (downloaded January 31, 2013), Dr. Noblitt offered an expanded version of a paper he presented in 1998. An examination of this article reveals that Noblitt fails to be aware of or to acknowledge many important scientific advances in understanding of the nature of recovered memories or ritual abuse accusations. His article contains a lengthy list of convictions obtained in ritual abuse cases, many of which involved accusations by children in day care settings. Although the cases are not identified by name, but rather by location, many of the cases can easily be matched to the high-profile trials at those locales. For example, the Kelly Michaels trial is readily identifiable within the list. Although the conviction in the Kelly Michaels case was reversed (in part for testimony similar to that given by Dr. Noblitt in the Keller case – testimony regarding using behavioral indicators as diagnostic of abuse), the case is retained in Noblitt’s analysis as a true ritual abuse case. He additionally fails to note the amicus brief of concerned social scientists, describing the suggestibility of children, that had been entered on behalf of Kelly Michaels, and which was subsequently published as a journal article in Psychology, Public Policy, and Law (Bruck &amp; Ceci, 1995). The amicus brief was prepared by developmental psychologists Maggie Bruck and Stephen Ceci, and signed by 45 social scientists, representing the fields of developmental, social, experimental, and clinical psychology. In fact, while Dr. Noblitt goes to some length in describing child victims of ritual abuse cults, he does not cite a single critic regarding the suggestibility of children.</p>
<p>In the same article by Noblitt (2007), he stated: “it has never been shown that people who report ritual abuse are particularly suggestible.” In contradistinction to this assertion, individuals with recovered memories of child abuse have been found to be more suggestible (Clancy, Schacter, McNally, &amp; Pitman, 2000; Geraerts, Smeets, Jelicic, van Heerden, &amp; Merckleback, 2005) and to exhibit a tendency for poor source monitoring of information (McNally, Clancy, Barrett, &amp; Parker, 2005). This illustrates a misreading or ignorance of recent research on clinical characteristics of those with recovered memories.</p>
<p>To cover one last example, again from the same paper, Dr. Noblitt cites a journal article by Dr. Bette Bottoms and her colleagues (described earlier in this document), with regard to the prevalence rates for clinicians believing their patients’ accounts of ritual abuse. As is typical of believers in ritual abuse, Dr. Noblitt selectively uses the information obtained by Bottoms and her colleagues by citing only the parts of their work related to prevalence of clinical encounters with alleged ritual abuse victims. Dr. Noblitt failed to mention that the paper specifically highlighted: (1) the lack of evidence for ritual abuse allegations, (2) the importance of social transmission of these concepts from therapist to client, (3) the general lack of skepticism evidenced by clinicians who encountered ritual abuse cases, and (4) the research team’s general conclusion that there is an overall lack of support for ritual abuse claims. Interestingly, Dr. Noblitt has self-published an edited volume (Noblitt &amp; Noblitt, 2008) in which this same error is made by four different contributors: They cite the work of Dr. Bottoms and her colleagues as support for the existence of ritual abuse, when in fact their research demonstrated lack of support for ritual abuse. In this Topsy-Turvey world of pseudoscience, anything goes.</p>
<p>In 2007, Dr. Noblitt made a presentation at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association, titled <em>Use of Sodium Amytal in Psychological Diagnosis and Treatment</em>. In a text accompanying the presentation, Dr. Noblitt describes “my own clinical experience conducting over 200 sodium amytal interviews” with patients who had been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorders. The use of sodium amytal as a memory retrieval tool is highly controversial. As far back as 1994, Piper reviewed twelve published studies on the use of sodium amytal interviews, and concluded that there was substantial evidence of memory distortion, sometimes involving gross distortions of factual material. Furthermore, evidence exists that sodium amytal is highly suggestive (and addictive). In a number of court cases, memories refreshed by amytal were found inadmissible (e.g., <em>Ramona v. Ramona</em>, 1997) because it contaminates memory. The fact that Dr. Noblitt has frequently used a technique that is considered dangerous in both medical and legal circles, and that he has apparently used it on individuals suffering from dissociative identity disorder, is deeply disconcerting. This may very well fall into the purview of psychological treatments that cause harm (Lilienfeld, 2007).</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Noblitt has demonstrated that: (1) he is uncritical of anyone whose views coincide with his own, (2) he is dismissive of “gold standard” scientific research that disconfirms his views, and (3) he misrepresents the scientific findings of others in an effort to advance his own agenda. These three points constitute an approach that is antithetical to the scientific accumulation of knowledge. Aspects of his clinical practice illustrated here further demonstrate that his beliefs and therapies fall far outside the mainstream of psychology and may have harmful effects for patients and others whom he considers to be victims of cult ritual abuse. His views are fringe views which only impede the efforts of the trier of fact, and may actually be overly prejudicial if presented to a jury.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Dr. Phil,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I write this letter to you with little hope of conveying information of which you were previously unaware. Rather, I write this letter so that the general public may be made aware of what <em>you should already be well aware of</em>, in hopes that they may appropriately measure your credibility following your forthcoming broadcast* related to the topic of an alleged satanic cult conspiracy &#8212; an episode which promises to be full of misinformation, delusions, harmful false accusations, and lies.<span id="more-967"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, it has come to my attention that you will be airing an interview with Judy Byington, author of a book entitled <em><a href="http://www.examiner.com/review/the-lunatics-are-all-therapists-a-review-of-22-faces-by-judy-byington?cid=db_articles">Twenty-Two Faces</a></em> which purports to be the true story of one Jenny Hill, an alleged victim of the bizarre and controversial psychiatric condition known as Dissociative Identity Disorder [DID] (formerly listed as Multiple Personality Disorder [MPD]).</p>
<p dir="ltr">However <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/08/a-story-that-doesnt-hold-up/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow">dubious the legitimacy of DID</a>, this diagnosis is by far the least of the problems with Byington’s book. <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> is openly rife with archaic demonologies, and paranoid conspiracy theories being presented as root causes to the disturbances in Ms. Hill’s troubled mind. That Jenny Hill &#8212; a former drug addict and prostitute with a history of mental illness &#8212; is troubled seems indisputable, but Byington’s book seeks to expose an alleged satanic government plot behind Hill’s mental malaise that is tantamount to speculation upon who, exactly, is beaming voices into the heads of schizophrenics. Such an ignorant approach to therapeutic practice is harmful to mental health consumers, and your endorsement of such can hardly be of any positive value to your viewers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader harm to the public mental health in endorsing a story as laden with paranoid delusion as <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> &#8212; especially insofar as it is a narrative specifically appealing to the mentally vulnerable &#8212; should be clear to a doctor of Clinical Psychology like yourself. In fact, as recently as the 1980’s (and extending into the 90s), stories of non-existent satanic cults &#8212; upon which Byington has based her unhinged claims &#8212; caused a modern witch-hunt now known to sociologists as the “<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Satanic_Panic">Satanic Panic</a>”. Books foundational to this panic, and thematically identical to <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> &#8212; particularly <em>Michelle Remembers</em> by Lawrence Pazder and Michelle Smith, and <em>Satan’s Underground</em> by Lauren Stratford &#8212; were soundly and thoroughly debunked by investigative journalists. Unfortunately, these debunkings only arrived after sensational talk-shows, promoting these books uncritically, helped create <a href="http://altreligion.about.com/od/satanism/f/satanic_panic.htm">a moral panic</a> that ruined families, resulted in false convictions of satanic crimes, and exploited the most irrational fears of countless mental health consumers. Both of these books are listed in Byington’s bibliography, despite their debunkings, and despite the fact the Satan’s Underground was <a href="http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html">so thoroughly discredited</a> as to be withdrawn from publication&#8230; following which the author changed her name and abandoned her story of Satanic Ritual Abuse to instead pose as a childhood victim of the Holocaust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the supernatural claims put forward in<em> Twenty-Two Faces</em> we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prophecy:</strong> The protagonist’s birth is foretold by her uncle in exacting detail. Through some other-worldly messenger he is “told” that “this was a special child who would do important things on this earth.”</li>
<li><strong>Extra Sensory Perception (ESP):</strong> apparently believing that child abuse can prove beneficial to the victim (a position I hope you disagree with), author Judy Byington describes that the protagonist, Jenny Hill, was able to break through certain subliminal barriers, not in spite of, but because of, early humiliations. “In the far reaches of her brain a storehouse of demeaning events evidently opened a door for Extra Sensory Perception experiences to enter.”</li>
<li><strong>Divine guidance:</strong> desperate and in prayer, Jenny Hill hears “a soft, yet thundering voice”, which urges her to “continue to write down your life experiences, for one day a book will be written.”</li>
<li><strong>Levitation:</strong> Byington describes a cult “filled with Black Magic, levitation, seances and chanting people”. Jenny Hill is admonished at one point that “[l]evitation and evil spirits weren’t anything to mess around with and certainly not worth the price it [sic] would extract.”</li>
<li><strong>Divine intervention:</strong> In the midst of a Satanic ceremony in which she is bound to an altar, Jenny Hill is spared from sacrifice by a bare-footed “white-robed male personage, surrounded in a glorious White Light”. (Had this “personage” taken a little effort to arrive just a moment earlier, he could have spared the unlucky girl next to Hill, who is said to have been decapitated&#8230; but I’m sure His schedule is as busy as His ways mysterious.)</li>
<li><strong>Spirit Possession:</strong> Making clear that possession isn’t merely a more primitive cultural interpretation of DID, Byington describes that Hill has suffered both DID and spirit possession, the latter being cured by the prayers of LDS church officials.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any one of these topics would be a bit much for one episode, and each of these remarkable claims demands remarkable evidence. So what evidence does Byington provide? Incredibly, <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> seems to rely solely on the “memories of [Jenny Hill’s] multiple personalities and their entries in diaries written since childhood”, as Byington describes in the book’s opening disclaimer. These memories were “repressed”, only recalled later in Ms. Hill’s life in the course of re-integrating her various fractured identities. Setting aside the fact that “recovered memories” similarly serve as the “evidentiary” basis for claims of Extraterrestrial abductions and past life regression, is it appropriate &#8212; in your professional opinion as a (former) Clinical Psychologist &#8212; to accept such extraordinary claims merely on personal testimony? Do you think it’s appropriate, Dr. Phil, to air fear-mongering claims of an anti-human, ubiquitous secret society on the “evidence” of such an unlikely anecdote?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even looking past the supernatural propositions, Byington’s book is fraught with inconsistencies, among which we find:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Twenty-Two Faces is said to have been constructed from “memories of [Jenny Hill’s] multiple personalities and their entries in diaries written since childhood”, a claim which makes no sense when considering that Jenny Hill is supposed to have been entirely ignorant of the existence of her multiple personalities until having entered psychiatric therapy in later adulthood. How, then, did she account for various unknown individuals writing their own personal, signed entries in her own private diaries consistently throughout her life?</li>
<li>Twenty-Two Faces describes that Jenny Hill was oppressed by an unlikely Jewish Nazi who worshipped Satan and was brought to the US from Germany under CIA sponsorship. Ludicrous as this alone is, Byington explains that this over-dramatized villain is careful to conceal his antics from Jenny Hill’s parents &#8212; returning her home on-time for supper, making sure her chores are finished before compelling her to return &#8212; yet we also learn later that Hill’s parents were in on the whole thing throughout.</li>
<li>We are made to understand that Hill begins to experience “lost time” at the age of 4, when her abuse is said to have begun. The lost time is accounted for as episodes during which other personalities took over her consciousness so that Hill might not be troubled with the terrors of the abuse she began suffering at that age. Such episodes, starting at such an early age, would establish an expectation of occasionally lost time, or an acceptance on the part of the protagonist that she had never quite grasped what time is. Not so with Ms. Hill. Not only did she fully grasp the cultural context and broad implications of the depravities that are said to have befallen her at age 4, she is also uncannily aware of the dates and times that eluded her at an age when most children are unable to properly read a clock. Does this match with your own knowledge of childhood cognitive development, Dr. Phil?</li>
<li>Hill learns, by means of &#8220;recovered memories&#8221; that she was raped by her father. She invites her parents to her psychiatric hospital, where she is an in-patient, so that she may accuse him. Apparently heartbroken and outraged, her father storms out. The inconsistency occurs some pages later when it is reported that Hill was saddened to not be invited over for the following Family Christmas.</li>

<p dir="ltr">You should be aware of serious problems with Byington’s book &#8212; the inconsistencies, improbabilities, and supernatural propositions &#8212; not least because you should be aware of the book’s contents before you endorse such material on your show, but also because<em> I personally reached out to your producers to warn you of them</em>. Your producers were surely also warned regarding Byington’s problematic narrative when in contact with Jenny Hill’s sister, who was also asked to appear on your show along with Mrs. Byington. Apparently, your producers &#8212; doing “entertainment” at the expense of good psychology &#8212; chose to ignore us both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The material above covers some problems that any rational person could pick out merely from reading the book, but there are further problems with <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> that are apparent to anybody who bothers to do a little research:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The book carries an endorsement from Robert Kroon, an esteemed former foreign correspondent for Time Magazine. However, Kroon had been dead for over 5 years at the time of Twenty-Two Faces’ publication</strong>. Suspiciously, Tate Publishing, the publisher of Twenty-Two Faces, uses <a href="http://www.tatepublishing.com/bookstore/book.php?w=978-1-60696-886-4">a similar endorsement</a>, allegedly from Kroon, on another book published 2 years after his death.</li>
<li><strong>Judy Byington has not had a license to practice therapy in around 10 years, yet she explicitly describes continuing to conduct therapy sessions with Jenny Hill only months ago</strong> (listen to this interview at 15:45: <a href="http://kcpw.org/blog/cityviews/2012-08-07/cityviews-8812-one-woman-multiple-personalitiesbullets-and-belles/">http://kcpw.org/blog/cityviews/2012-08-07/cityviews-8812-one-woman-multiple-personalitiesbullets-and-belles/</a>). Judy Byington also offers “therapy” over the phone or via Skype at $25 per session. Do you, Dr. Phil, endorse this type of unlicensed, not to mention grossly irrational, “therapy”?</li>
<li><strong>Jenny Hill remains mentally tormented and has a history of bearing false witness</strong>. <em>Twenty-Two Faces</em> describes an episode in which Jenny Hill fled from Judy Byington for a time believing that she had observed “the mark of cain” somewhere on Byington, indicated that Byington was involved, somehow, with satanic cults… yet it never seems to have occurred to Byington that any other paranoid claims of Jenny’s may have been rooted in suspicious delusion, rather than fact. In a very telling exchange (that can be read here: <a href="http://dysgenicsreport.blogspot.com/2012/10/replies-to-22-faces-claims-hard.html#more">http://dysgenicsreport.blogspot.com/2012/10/replies-to-22-faces-claims-hard.html#more</a>) Jenny Hill’s sister questioned Byington regarding why it is Byington unquestioningly believes many of Jenny’s unprovable claims, while knowing that Jenny has made various unfounded claims in apparent fits of panicked paranoia: “Did you believe her when she said your husband was coming on to her sexually? I have heard that allegation too many times about other men to take it seriously. [&#8230;] [H]ow many times has she called you in the middle of the night to come rescue her from some drama only to find her asleep and not knowing she had called or claiming she was being held hostage and you come with police to find her watching TV[?] …” Judy Byington proved unwilling or unable to answer these questions of Jenny Hill’s sister. Was she able to answer such questions of you? Did you even ask? If not, why not? These facts were available to you before you filmed your interview with Mrs. Byington.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">I hardly expect to see that you have asked any difficult, yet terribly obvious, questions of Judy Byington in your soon-to-be-aired interview, as Byington’s own website now proudly displays your endorsement:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">“Dear Judy,</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Thank you for taking the time to come to our show. I wish you great success with your book documenting the life of Jenny Hill and look forward to working with you in the future. God Bless!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr. Phil, Paramount Pictures Hollywood”</h3>
<p>That this makes you complicit in purveying a delusional conspiracy theory is unfortunate, but hardly disputable. Judy Byington herself <a href="http://www.shewrites.com/profiles/blogs/guest-post-from-judy-byington-author-of-22-faces">makes clear</a> that she considers Dissociative Identity Disorder/Multiple Personality Disorder synonymous with Satanic Ritual Abuse, and you can hardly talk to her about one without addressing the other. To be clear, when Judy Byington talks of multiplicity and dissociative trauma, she is talking about a debunked conspiracy theory of satanic mind-control plots. That you should give such hysterical claims air-time &#8212; allowing a conspiracy theory to be presented as a diagnosis &#8212; on your widely viewed show is beyond irresponsible. It makes you a menace to the public mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have no illusion that you will correct your errors, or that you might pull the episode before it airs. Rather, I am simply posting this time-stamped letter to you here &#8212; which I will also send to you directly &#8212; so that neither you, nor your producers, may possibly claim ignorance in the near future when Judy Byington meets with the critical assault that will inevitably follow when sensible people see fit to read her work. I want it to be perfectly clear, now and in the future, that all the facts were available to you at all times. It is my feeling that your credibility should greatly suffer, and it is my wish that you should soon find yourself as bankrupt financially as you are ethically.</p>

Hopefully, Phil wises up and pulls the interview entirely, however, yesterday Judy Byington left a comment online that the episode should air &#8220;soon&#8221;.

<p>Sound thinking and critical reservations were abruptly cast aside in New Delhi during the early morning hours of September 21st, 1995. Statue idols, it seemed, had taken to drinking milk being fed to them by spoon. By what bizarre urging the first pilgrim to report this phenomenon was compelled to test whether a milk offering would pass the lips of a statue is unclear, but the idea rapidly took hold, devolving into a frenzy. The World Hindu Council hastily declared it a “miracle”, and by noon hopeful herds across North India stampeded to the temples leaving trampled bodies wounded underfoot. Police reinforcements were deployed by necessity to restrain outbreaks among the fevered milk-bearing mobs. Faithful conviction ruled the day.</p>
<p>Some believers may well have been unamused &#8212; especially those within the ranks of the afflicted and dying &#8212; that the gods had chosen such a valueless display with which to affirm their continued beneficent authority, but it was the science-minded <em>un</em>believers who were predictably the least impressed&#8230; Nor did it take long to figure out what was really going on. Representatives from India’s Ministry of Science and Technology arrived on-scene to demonstrate that what was being witnessed was simple “capillary action”: The surface tension of the milk created an upward pull upon contact with the surface of the statue before the liquid ran downward in a transparent film, while some was absorbed into the porous stones. To illustrate this, the scientists colored their milk with a dye that remained apparent as it coated the statue. When hysteria regarding milk imbibing statues struck again in 2006, the president of the Indian Rationalist Association, Sanal Edamaruku, was quoted in the press, “Forget deities. I fed a cup of coffee to a statue of Jawaharlal Nehru (India&#8217;s first prime minister) right before television cameras,” he said, “Even bricks are drinking milk.”<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><span id="more-904"></span></p>
<p>The 1995 “Milk Miracle” hysteria spread throughout the world within the span of several days and has seen recurrences in the years since, despite the oft-repeated claim that the phenomenon was mysteriously confined within a 24-hour span. Faithful supernaturalists have proved predictably unwilling to abdicate their miracle to non-magical explanations. Nor has the lasting insistence that the Milk Miracle remains a mystery unsolved been confined to willfully credulous Hindus. A widely used college-level World Religions textbook states in its 2011 edition, referencing the 1995 incident: “Scientists suggested explanations such as mass hysteria or capillary action in the stone, but the phenomenon lasted only one day.”<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>To refer to the statement above as merely misrepresentative may be overly kind. “Scientists suggested explanations” indicates befuddled skeptics groping for generalized answers with which to force the inexplicable into a materialist framework. In fact, scientists did more than “suggest” capillary action, they demonstrated it. And it was never an either/or question between mass hysteria <em>or</em> capillary action &#8212; capillary action accounted for the illusion of milk drinking statues, while mass hysteria best described the temple-swarming religious fervor that the misattribution of “miracle” provoked. Both capillary action and mass hysteria were perfectly evident. To state that it could have been either/or further suggests confusion among scientists unable to accept a miracle taking place before their eyes, while also unable to come to a consensus amongst each other as to what might account for what was being witnessed.</p>
<p>More flagrantly misleading still are the countless accounts of the Milk Miracle which claim that scientists dismissed the entire event as a “mass hallucination”. The site <em>milkmiracle.com</em>, maintained by an outspoken Milk Miracle true believer, Philip Mikas, states:</p>
<p><em>There are many sceptics and scientists who have tried to explain what happened on September 21, 1995 in terms of science. Some have repeatedly said that this so-called &#8220;Milk Miracle&#8221; was caused by something as simple as capillary action. Some have tried to attribute it to a case of &#8220;global scale mass hallucination or hysteria&#8221;. To them, I would like to say this &#8211; there are many things that we just cannot explain with our present levels of science and technology. Perhaps, we will need to look into our souls and discover the secret spiritual powers that we all have before we can fully explain such phenomena. </em></p>
<p>Oddly, among a great many of the sites that treat the Milk Miracle as an unexplained or paranormal phenomenon, the phrase “global scale mass hallucination or hysteria” is offered as a summary of the skeptical position, always in quotes, never with attribution.</p>
<p>And so it degenerates&#8230; the actual explanation rejected, marginalized, obscured, and ultimately re-written to the point that numerous bloggers now treat the question of the Milk Miracle as one of <em>mass hallucination</em> versus <em>paranormal activity</em>, weighing the merits of &#8212; or elaborating the flaws in &#8212; an explanation that never was.</p>
<p>Presenting the scientific attempt at a rational explanation as a snobbish dismissal of mass eyewitness testimony certainly has its advantages to those who wish to maintain that something otherworldly was plainly observed, and arguments against the mass hallucination theory can be found anywhere believers in the improbable attempt to make their case. Thus, throughout the vast blogosphere, lengthy essays can be found heaping derision upon this scientific folly in favor of claims ranging from Sasquatch’s existence, to the reality of extraterrestrial visitations, to Satanic cults conspiring to enslave the Globe&#8230; to any number of implausible and bizarre ideas believed by a resolute minority. Almost universally lacking in these tirades against the close-minded “scientific establishment” is any direct citation of an actual argument in favor of the mass hallucination theory, nor is mass hallucination explicitly defined, its meaning presumed intuitively clear.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the idea of any specific event being attributed to “mass hallucination” sounds ridiculous. It suggests a large number of people suddenly, simultaneously, and spontaneously experiencing an intense, shared, detailed, false or grossly distorted shared perception of an event or events contrary to the reality surrounding them. At its most crudely literal, this would have us interpreting the Milk Miracle as an event wherein masses of individuals merely perceived milk disappearing from their spoons, while in actuality it did not; Sasquatch as a sudden unprovoked mental phantom shared amongst unwitting forest explorers; UFOs as but internal synchronized specters projected upon the empty skies.</p>
<p>But is this what “mass hallucination” actually means? And has there ever actually been an anomalous event for which mass hallucination was offered as a scientific explanation? Or &#8212; as with the Milk Miracle &#8212; is the idea of Mass Hallucination merely a straw man argument meant to paint the skeptical position as both improbable and patronizing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>A search for “mass hallucination” in the American Psychological Association’s PsycINFO &#8212; “an expansive abstracting and indexing database with more than 3 million records devoted to peer-reviewed literature in the behavioral sciences and mental health [&#8230;] covering psychology back to its underpinnings in the 17th Century” &#8212; yields a total of zero articles. Of course, this does not bode well as an indication of the concept’s interest among serious researchers.</p>
<p>However, the concept of “<em>collective</em> hallucinations” &#8212; first expounded by French polymath Gustave Le Bon in his 1895 classic book on Crowd Psychology, <em>La psychologie des foules </em>(translated into english as <em>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind) </em>&#8212; has a minimal  presence in psychology books related to Mob Mentality and psychological anomalies.</p>
<p>In <em>The Crowd</em>, Le Bon described inflated suggestibility as a general characteristic of human herds. “[&#8230;] a crowd [is] perpetually hovering on the borderland of unconsciousness, readily yielding to all suggestions, having all the violence of feeling peculiar to beings who cannot appeal to the influence of reason, deprived of all critical faculty, cannot be otherwise than excessively credulous.”<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> This excessive credulity, according to Le Bon, primes the crowd to accept, as fact ,“[t]he first perversion of the truth effected by one of the individuals of the gathering”, which then becomes “the starting point of the contagious suggestion.”<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Collective hallucinations then, by Le Bon’s definition, are the outcome of perceptual interpretations colored by suggestions delivered to a crowd in its throes of thoughtless zeal.</p>
<p>The concept is further expanded upon in a book titled <em>Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking</em> by Leonard Zusne and Warren H. Jones<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>. There, the authors confront the question of &#8212; if an event is presumably hallucinated &#8212; how do “2 or 200 people manage to coordinate and synchronize their subjective lives?”</p>
<p><em>“In collective hallucinations, expectation plays the coordinating role. Although the subjective matter of individual hallucinations has virtually no limits, that of collective hallucinations is limited to certain categories. These categories are determined, first, by the kinds of ideas that a group of people may get excited about as a group, for emotional arousal is a prerequisite of collective hallucinations.” </em></p>
<p>Collective hallucinations, according to Zusne and Jones, are not spontaneous occurrences, and in accompaniment to “emotional arousal”, there is the prerequisite of “spreading imagery”&#8230;</p>
<p><em>“[&#8230;] all participants in the hallucination must be informed beforehand, at least concerning the broad outlines of the phenomenon that will constitute the collective hallucination. This may take the form of a publicly announced prophecy, for example, or someone suddenly looking up and saying, ‘Lo, in the sky!’ or words to that effect.”</em></p>
<p>And while the imagery preceding the event may only contain the “broad outlines of the phenomenon”, it is important to note that, due to the reconstructive nature of memory, the hallucinations themselves need only be broadly similar&#8230;</p>
<p><em>“Once the general type of hallucination is identified, it is easy to harmonize individual differences in accounts. This may take place during the hallucination or in subsequent discussions.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***** </strong></p>
<p>As examples of collective hallucinations, Zusne and Jones offer several occasions at various locations in Italy where locals reported “moving and bleeding images of saints”.</p>
<p>Also, in 1981, in Yugoslavia, in a village called Medjugorje, a small group of children reported meeting and speaking with the mythical “Virgin” Mary, whereupon some estimated 11 million pilgrims travelled to the childrens’ village. These pilgrims stared into the sky, toward the sun, looking for Mary’s divine form at an appointed time and place. Interestingly, despite their priming, none of them seemed to manage an actual vision of Mary herself. However, they did report anomalous visions, “such as [&#8230;] crosses in the sky, double suns”, and some reported “being able to stare at the setting sun without eye damage.”<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Similar to the Medjugorje incident, the famous Fatima apparition of 1917 was a mob reaction to reports made by 3 Portuguese children who claimed to have been visited by the ghost of Mary. Here again, reports were less-than-impressive as far as presumably synchronous specific subjective events are concerned. The children, it is claimed, saw the Virgin, while some of the crowd reported seeing the sun “dancing” in the sky, radiant colors, or the sun approaching the Earth&#8230; Others still saw nothing at all.</p>
<p>Of course, the sun did not make any aberrant movements that day, as witnessing astronomical observatories could attest. The same sun, visible to much of the world, appeared to be following its daily routine everywhere but where expectations for a miracle found faithful pilgrims looking to the sky in anticipation of something extraordinary.</p>
<p>In both Medjugorje and Fatima, observers were staring into the sunlit sky. Joe Nickell (author and Senior Research Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry [CSI]) explains, “several eyewitnesses of the October 13, 1917, gathering at Fatima specifically stated they were looking ‘fixedly at the sun’ or ‘tried to look straight at it’ or otherwise made clear they were gazing directly at the actual sun [&#8230;]. If this is so, the ‘dancing sun’ and other solar phenomena may have been due to optical effects resulting from temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at such an intense light or to the effect of darting the eyes to and fro to avoid fixed gazing (thus combining image, afterimage, and movement).”<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>If UV-beaten eyes are responsible for reports of Fatima’s dancing sun, Zusne and Jones are unclear as to whether their definition of mass hallucination is meant to describe such illusions for which an organic cause is apparent. In either case, however, the prerequisite conditions of emotional arousal, spreading imagery, as well as the subsequent harmonizing of the narrative from various disparate reports, were clearly extremely influential factors in Medjugorje and Fatima.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p> In 2001, Christian apologist Gary Habermas published a paper titled <em>Explaining Away Jesus’ Resurrection: the Recent Revival of Hallucination Theories</em><a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>. Though Habermas explains that he surveyed “over 1,000 critical publications on the resurrection”, he offers no hard numbers with which to qualify his claim of any recent “revival of hallucination theories”. In vague terms, he reports, “more scholars apparently support various naturalistic hypotheses [to account for the biblical claim of Christ’s resurrection] than has been the case in many decades. [&#8230;] Of those who now prefer hallucination explanations, however, only a few scholars have pursued this approach in detail, while several other scholars simply mention the possibility of, or preference for, the hallucination thesis.”</p>
<p>A preference for “the hallucination thesis” opposed to what, one wonders? Opposed to other “naturalistic hypotheses” (such as the quite obvious explanation that the New Testament is a poor fictional work from the start) mass hallucination weighs in rather weakly; opposed to accepting the resurrection myth at its face value, however, mass hallucination can clearly be assigned a much higher probabilistic value by mere virtue of <em>being</em> a naturalistic hypothesis. Missing this point completely, Habermas asks, “[&#8230;] why must a naturalistic, subjective explanation be assumed?”</p>
<p>Though the question is presented rhetorically, there <em>is</em> sound rationale for assuming naturalistic explanations. To begin, while there is ample cross-cultural research demonstrating the human tendency to embrace superstition and to exert self-deceiving confirmation biases, there is no such research at all that satisfactorily demonstrates any supernatural phenomena. For that matter, supernatural forces are, by definition, not observable &#8212; they cannot be recorded, transcribed, traced, or measured by scientific procedure. As we can never isolate a mechanistic cause of a supernatural event, we are left with simply no other option than exhaust all naturalistic options first.</p>
<p>Further, history provides hard lessons in the unreliability of even large consensus accounts. The archaic minds of Christian philosophers, from Augustine to Thomas Aquinas, took seriously claims of demonic assaults upon humanity by mere virtue of the claims’ ubiquity, Aquinas even insisting that reports of demonic voices could not have been imaginary as they were reported to be heard to all within earshot.<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> From this logic, prosecutions and brutal purgings of “witches” were deemed sound and fair due to their multiple corroborating witness accounts.</p>
<p>Habermas goes on to contest Zusne and Jones’s description of collective hallucination as it <em>might</em> be applied to the myth of Christ’s resurrection, though he concedes that Zusne and Jones themselves wrote of collective hallucinations “without any application to Jesus’ resurrection”. Further, none of the <em>only three</em> authors from this “revival” of hallucination theories Habermas explores &#8212; as examples of those who share a “hallucination theory preference” &#8212; invoke Zusne and Jones’s collective hallucination definition to support their positions. Nor are <em>these</em> authors unclear as to what they themselves mean when referring to the resurrection as a hallucination.<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Of the three authors Habermas disputes, only German theologian Gerd Luedemann advances an explanation directly born of an established collective hallucination theory. Invoking Le Bon, Luedemann describes the appearance of the resurrected Christ to “more than 500 brethren” as “mass ecstasy” stimulated by the “preaching and the recollections” by Peter and the twelve disciples who saw Jesus die on the cross. This proselytizing devotion, according to Luedemann, “led to religious intoxication and an enthusiasm which was experienced as the presence of Jesus[&#8230;]”</p>
<p>Summarizing this without offering a direct counterpoint, Habermas goes on to protest against hypotheses published by two more theologians, Jack A. Kent and Michael Goulder. Kent, in his book <em>The Psychological Origins of the Resurrection Myth</em>, proposes that Jesus’s cult <em>individually</em> “experienced grief-related hallucinations or illusions following the traumatic death of their leader”.<a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> Kent details the Gospel accounts of “the Easter morning events” and notes that they are “inconsistent, contradictory, and inconclusive”, though he argues that “Mary Magdalene and the disciples did see what they believed were ‘appearances’ of Jesus but those ‘appearances’ were grief-related hallucinations or illusions.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Goulder, in his essay <em>The Baseless Fabric of a Vision</em><a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a>, describes Peter’s vision of the resurrected Christ as a personal vision &#8212; a <em>conversion vision</em> &#8212; which he likens to violent conversions reported throughout history wherein the convert typically describes visions accompanying an intense feeling of revelation. As an example, Goulder cites Manson Family murderer Susan Atkins’ prison conversion, which she described in visual terms, with Christ personally appearing to her offering consolation and forgiveness.</p>
<p>The appearances of Christ to the apostles or the 500 brethren, however, are seen as a collective <em>delusion</em> by Goulder, which he likens to today’s Bigfoot phenomenon. With both Bigfoot and Jesus expectation and popular enthusiasm precipitated sightings. “If you sighted Bigfoot, you were the centre of attention; people spoke about you; the press sought you out. If you sighted Jesus, you confirmed the Church’s hopes, and your own.”</p>
<p>Despite these descriptions of purely personal hallucinations acting to precipitate group delusions of resurrection, Habermas &#8212; after breezily under-summarizing each author’s actual position &#8212; disingenuously states: “One of the central issues in this entire discussion concerns whether a group of people can witness the same hallucination.” In fact, this appears only to be the central point that Habermas was predetermined to argue, while his survey of “over 1,000 critical publications” seems to have yielded little to indicate that this was ever at issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>From the few academic descriptions available, authored by Le Bon and Zusne and Jones, we see that collective hallucinations are not intended to describe spontaneous herd occurrences of perfectly matched phantasmagoria. Nor is it irrelevant to emphasize the difference in terminology: <em>collective</em> hallucination, as opposed to the often-invoked <em>mass</em> hallucination which, while subtle, further reinforces the suspicion that those arguing against <em>mass hallucination theory</em> (in favor of their cherished chosen implausibility) are in fact inveighing against an imaginary opposition.</p>
<p>While “collective hallucinations” find a negligible presence in psychological literature, “mass hallucination theory” is disproportionately invoked as the primary &#8212; if not <em>only</em> &#8212; explanation offered to counter extraordinary claims for which there are (presumably) multiple corroborating witnesses. So long as this position is maintained, arguments for paranormal events are presented as less incredible than the alleged scientific alternative: that a mass of people all at once spontaneously shared a detailed mental vision, much like a group of people watching a film, and collectively mistook this shared vision for an external physical reality.</p>
<p>When “mass hallucination” is said to be the scientific counterpoint to any claim, it is worth asking, <em>By which scientists? Where?</em> <em>What other explanations have been proposed?</em> and, of course, <em>“Mass hallucination” meaning what, exactly?</em> Upon inspection, we find that the idea of mass hallucination as the fall-back end-all “scientific” position toward the inexplicable is, in itself, nothing more than a desperately crafted mass delusion&#8230; a bullshit argument &#8212; attributed to rational arguments against bullshit &#8212; that is meant to make said rational arguments look like bullshit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><em>The following article was submitted to Process.org by &#8220;J. Bean&#8221; &#8211; a false memory expert who has been closely following the Mohler cases and attending the hearings&#8230;.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Western Missouri Condemns Without Trial</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">By J. Bean (A Skeptic in Kansas City)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">March 2010</p>
<p><strong><em>“[For law enforcement officers] the level of proof necessary for taking action on allegations of criminal acts must be more than simply the victim alleged it and it is possible…. We need to be concerned about the distribution and publication of unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre sexual abuse.” </em></strong>&#8211; Kenneth Lanning, FBI</p>
<p>Dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled at their wrists, ankles, and waists, six members of the Mohler family shuffle past local television news cameras and into a courtroom. Tethered together, they resemble fish on a stringer with the proud authorities displaying their catch.  On-the-spot reporters read the charges against them,“Forcible rape of a child; Deviate sexual assault; Use of a child in a sexual performance…”  Newspaper accounts are perhaps even more harsh: The men’s booking photos are posted beneath headlines such as “Incest Allegations Shatter Public image of Church-Going Clan”, [1] or “Child-Raping Missouri Family May Have Bodies in Yard”. [2 ] Posted on the internet  beneath these stories  are reader  comments reminiscent of 1692; judgments of guilt  and cries for harsh punishment along with suspicions cast upon any who question the charges dominate the boards.</p>
<p>The men are 76 year old Burrell Mohler Sr., his four sons, Burrell “Ed” Jr., David, Jared, and Roland, and Burrell Sr.’s 72 year old brother, Darryl Mohler. The arrests were made in November 2009, by Lafayette County, Missouri authorities based on accusations of ritualistic crimes against Ed Mohler’s (now adult) children from 1988 to 1995. The charges against the men involve numerous alleged child rapes, sodomies, and bestiality. They are also publicly accused of kidnapping, various murders, producing child pornography, breeding then slaughtering babies, performing forced abortions on minors, and holding an unwilling sex-slave for years in the family basement, although there have been no charges filed for those allegations.<span id="more-879"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>“A hallucination is a fact, not an error; what is erroneous is a judgment based upon it.”</em> </strong>– Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>The case against the Mohler men first came to Lafayette County authorities in August 2009, when Ed Mohler’s 26 year old daughter (T.A.) contacted a western Missouri detective.   According to the probable cause statements: (T.A.) had “<em>suppressed many of the memories”</em> until recently. She <em>“identified 8 specific memories of abuse and a 9th that was perpetrated on her brother”.  “She has many memories of abuse”</em> but some occurred in other jurisdictions.  <em>“She became pregnant and was made to have an abortion at age 11 ½.  She doesn’t remember any sexual abuse after that date.”</em>[3]</p>
<p>Even if the word “suppressed” had not been used, the pointed use of the word “memories” in the report is indicative of repressed memory accusations. Generally when people report past events they do not do so under the context of “identifying memories”.</p>
<p>After those initial accusations in August, authorities made contact with, and began to question the other five siblings. On October 7th, three of the siblings (T.A.), (A.J.), and (E.M.) provided authorities with a 36 page collaborative report detailing several murders they witnessed spanning two Missouri counties. They were able to lead authorities to the approximate spot they say they helped to bury one of the murder victims. On October 29th, (T.A.) again spoke with the detective; this time alleging that she recalled her grandfather keeping a female child in his basement crawlspace. The siblings also told authorities that as they were being abused, the men told them to write down what was happening to them. These notes were placed in mason jars then buried.  The siblings say their abusers told them that if they buried these notes, their memories would also become buried. [4][5]</p>
<p>A fourth sibling (E.W.) told police that he had once unearthed some of those jars as a child, but reburied them at the request of his sisters.[4] Based on these statements, a search warrant was issued for the farm previously owned by Burrell Mohler Sr. to search for bodies, other evidence of murder, items from the crawlspace, and the mason jars. [6]</p>
<p>On November 10, 2009, as authorities swarmed the Bate City farmhouse with backhoes and shovels, detectives from Lafayette and various other counties were dispatched to arrest Burrell Sr. and his sons.</p>
<p><strong><em>“A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” </em></strong>&#8211; Winston Churchill</p>
<p>As the arrests were made public, lead investigator, Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh, held a press conference. The stated purpose for the conference was to urge other possible victims to come forward. Specifically, investigators wished to locate the girl said to have been held captive in the basement crawlspace.</p>
<p>There were, however, other remarks of interest made during that press conference. One comment in particular gives further reason to suspect that all of the accusers are engaged in the recovering of repressed memories: <strong>Q:</strong> <em>“How does the time factor complicate the case?”</em> <strong>A:</strong> <em>“Time factor always complicates a case. But when memories of this come out with the victims, as you talk about it, as you investigate it, more comes out.”</em> [7]</p>
<p>Alumbaugh also defended the large amounts of county resources used to investigate the case, insisting the expenditures are important for protecting children: <em> “You can read the probable cause statements as we leave and understand that this is money well spent of the tax payer’s dollars to bring these people to justice” …“They’ve had a threat to cut investigators…So, I mean, these are things that are really impacting our budgets and are very worthwhile to do because of the children.”</em>[7]</p>
<p>Possibly most important, were the personal motivations Sheriff Alumbaugh expressed: <em>“You personally attach it to yourself. You have children at home. You think about your children, you think about children that you know. Our biggest concern right now are those victims and those children that are out there that are potential victims. So, each one of us takes this very personally.”</em>[7]</p>
<p><strong><em>“All wrong-doing is done in the sincere belief that it is the best thing to do” </em></strong>– Arnold Bennet</p>
<p>Perhaps Sheriff Alumbaugh was thinking of a 5 year old girl he met in 2006, and hoping that, through aggressively pursuing the Mohler men, he could begin to repair his part in that child’s tragedy:</p>
<p>In 2006, the nude, battered body of 41 year old Marsha Spicer was found in a shallow grave in Lafayette County. Lorie Dunfield, a friend of Spicer’s, reported to authorities that she believed Spicer may have been involved with a man named Richard Davis. Dunfield reported that Richard Davis had recently asked her to assist him in videotaping the torture and murder of other women during three-way sex. <em>&#8220;He wanted me to help him kill women and get rid of the bodies.&#8221; </em>Dunfield said.[8]  Lorie Dunfield managed to get away from Davis, but believed that her friend, Marsh Spicer, may have later hooked up with him. Sheriff Alumbaugh and his deputies were called to interview Richard Davis and his girlfriend, Dena Riley, in regard to the Spicer homicide.</p>
<p>Richard Davis was already being sought by his parole officer after serving 16 years for raping and sodomizing a woman at knife point. His parole officer had been unable to contact him for a drug screening. Upon arriving at Davis’ apartment, investigators noted a video camera trained on the bed, an open journal with notations about choking and sex, and marijuana on a table. During that initial interview, Davis’ girlfriend Dena Riley admitted that Davis was into violent sex.</p>
<p>Rather than detain Davis, Sheriff Alumbaugh told Richard Davis and Dena Riley to leave the premises while he applied for a search warrant. Alumbaugh and his deputies returned hours later. The investigators viewed the tape currently in the VCR next to Davis’ bed. It was a “snuff video” of the rape, beating, and strangulation of Marsha Spicer. It appeared that the couple may have been watching the video just prior to the Sheriff and deputies’ arrival. Regrettably, since Alumbaugh had not detained Davis and Riley, they had fled the city. It was eight days before a nationwide manhunt managed to locate the couple for arrest. During this time, Richard Davis kidnapped and raped a 5 year old girl. The child’s injuries were so severe; she had to be airlifted to a hospital.</p>
<p>Police Chief Fred Mills defended Alumbaugh’s decision,<em> &#8220;You can spin the facts any way you want. But we had no probable cause to arrest them. What you need for an arrest warrant is a lot more than you need for a search warrant.&#8221;</em> Alumbaugh said, <em>“We just didn&#8217;t have enough (evidence). We weren&#8217;t ready to do hard questioning on them.”</em></p>
<p>None-the-less, Alumbaugh arrested the six Mohler men with only accusations from the alleged victims. These men had no parole violations, no drugs on their nightstands, and no past convictions for violent rapes. In fact they had no criminal histories at all. There were no bodies recently discovered in shallow graves, neither were the men holed up in shabby apartments with meth-addicted girlfriends. The Mohler men were arrested while at home with their wives or working for their longtime employers, to be charged with crimes allegedly occurring decades ago.</p>
<p>Newly appointed prosecutor, Kellie Ritchie filed the charges. It was while working as assistant DA in Buchanan County that Ritchie began concentrating on sexual assault cases. Four years out of law school, Ritchie was ready for greater responsibility at the same time that her boss wished to have one prosecutor handle all sexual abuse cases.[9] Ritchie readily accepted that challenge and helped to open a children’s advocacy center. Since her February, 2009 appointment to the Lafayette County office, Ritchie has continued her dedication to assisting victims of rape, raising awareness through a county Denim Day, [10] and promising the vigorous prosecution of any in possession of child pornography. [11] While these are all commendable pursuits; could this focus have clouded the prosecutor’s judgment in filing charges based on dubious repressed memory accusations?</p>
<p><strong><em>“An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation”</em></strong> – Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p>The Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI has assisted in investigations of hundreds of cases in which adults begin to report that they were victims of extreme abuses as children. Allegations involve multiple victims and multiple offenders and often include insertion of foreign objects, witnessing mutilations, as well as sexual acts and murders being filmed or photographed. In several of these cases, women claim to have had babies that were turned over for human sacrifice. Such accusations are most common in rural or suburban communities with high concentrations of religiously conservative people. According to Behavioral Science Unit Supervisory Agent Kenneth Lanning, <em>“In none of the multidimensional child sex ring cases of which I am aware have bodies of the murder victims been found &#8211; in spite of major excavations where the abuse victims claim the bodies were located. …Not only are no bodies found, but also, more importantly, there is no physical evidence that a murder took place. Many of those not in law enforcement do not understand that, while it is possible to get rid of a body, it is even more difficult to get rid of the physical evidence that a murder took place.”</em> – Kenneth Lanning, FBI [12]</p>
<p>In 1994, the US Government funded a study by The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Researchers found more than 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse, but none were able to be substantiated. The principle investigator in that study, Dr. Gail Goodman, commented, <em>“While you would not expect to find corroborating evidence in many sexual abuse cases, you would expect it when people claim the rituals involved murders, and the reported cases come from district attorneys or police&#8230;If there is anyone out there with solid evidence… we would like to know about it.&#8221;</em>[13][14] Large scale government funded investigations were also conducted in the states of Michigan, Utah, and Virginia with the same empty-handed results.</p>
<p>If Lafayette County officials were familiar with any of these reports, they should not have been surprised to find only one broken jar (no note), a bone fragment (unknown type), some broken eyeglasses, half a credit card, and a shoe sole in their excavation of the Bates City farm.[15]</p>
<p><strong><em>It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.  It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.</em></strong> – Mark Twain</p>
<p>The Sheriff’s press conference proved more fruitful than the farm excavation. The following day, a woman came forward claiming to have been held in the basement’s crawlspace for several years as a child. <em> “She recalls becoming pregnant twice while in captivity.   Burrell Sr. and Burrell Ed Jr. put the first infant in a box and buried it in the dirt floor under the window. Days later, the floor was covered in concrete.”</em>[16] Ground penetrating radar was used to locate a “box-like” area under the concrete and a new search warrant issued. Detectives returned to the farmhouse, broke open the concrete floor, but found only dirt.  Samples of the dirt were removed for analysis.[17] Announcements of basement sex-slave and her murdered infant made for more sensational headlines, although no charges were ever filed in regard to her. Three weeks later, Sheriff Alumbaugh said that the woman <em>“is longer part of this investigation.”</em>[18] This proclamation has not been widely reported.</p>
<p>In addition to the basement captive, a local man whose ex-wife had once been married to Ed Mohler came forward following the press conference. Mark Young and Pamela Young divorced in 1993 with Pamela gaining custody of their son. Pamela then married Ed Mohler in 1999. Mr. Young has interviewed on several television news programs, as well as with print media, claiming that Ed’s ex-wife (mother of the accusers), Jeanette Mohler (Cyr) had come to him in January 2000 alleging that Ed was abusing Mark and Pamela’s son. Mr. Young says that he then filed complaints and won custody of the boy in an emergency hearing. Public records show, however, that Mark Young did not file for custody of his son until 2002.[19]  His ex-wife had already divorced Ed Mohler nearly a year prior, in the spring of 2001.[20]</p>
<p>The siblings’ mother, Jeanette Mohler, told investigators that she knew about, or suspected the abuse at the time it was happening.<em> “At the time, complaints by the mother were taken to the head of the church rather than law enforcement”</em>. [21] Bishop Tonga, now retired, recalls Jeanette’s complaints to him. Tonga says he interviewed both Ed and the siblings and they all denied the mother’s accusations. No further action was taken by the mother or by Mr. Tonga. Only Ed, Jeanette, and their children were members of Mr. Tonga’s congregation. No complaints were taken to any member of the other men’s churches.</p>
<p>The statements made by Jeanette Mohler are puzzling. Just as the original accusations have expanded to include bestiality, kidnappings, and murders, they have also expanded in time, now encompassing twelve years, from 1983 to 1995. Jeanette remained married to Ed throughout this time, not filing for divorce until 1997. During their divorce, both Ed and Jeanette continued to attend the Independence Missouri Mormon Church. It’s more probable that it was during this period that the mother began leveling these complaints against her husband to her church, and to her six children.</p>

<p>Defendant Burrell Mohler Sr. has been the most maligned in the media due to the finding of “incest pornography” at his home. On the day of his arrest, his wife, Sandra Mohler, voluntarily allowed investigators into all common areas of the house.  (Some areas were excluded as they are private quarters for an unrelated boarder). According to the investigator’s affidavit, Mrs. Mohler explained to Jackson County Detective Cathy Covey that she and her husband had arranged for separate bedrooms <em>“after she had discovered he was viewing magazines and videos depicting persons involved in sexual activity”</em>.[21]  (This statement has been consistently misquoted in the press). Mrs. Mohler reported that although they had begun to sleep separately, both had full access to all areas of the residence. She indicated that her husband commonly used the computer in her room because he had never set-up internet access for the computer in his basement bedroom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mohler also <em>“had full permission to enter his sleeping area downstairs”</em>.[22] She stated that on two occasions she had looked in hidden areas of her husband’s bedroom to find his pornography. She told Detective Covey that she had taken away the magazines she found most objectionable and locked them in her file cabinet. Mrs. Mohler voluntarily supplied the investigators with the key to that filing cabinet. The magazines she had locked away included 5 digest style magazines which showed photos of adult models, engaged in sexual activity, with narratives depicting incestuous relationships.[22]<em> “Incest is, in fact, sexual relations between individuals of any age too closely related to marry. It need not necessarily involve an adult and a child”</em>.[12] Those 5 magazines are the most widely reported finding to imply the guilt of all six men, although none of them involve children or even models who appear to be children. The primary stash of pornography, later found in Burrell Sr.’s sleeping quarters, consisted of at least 65 more magazines, movies, and books – none of which were incest related.[23] In fact, many of these were specifically about and for senior citizens. One dvd has the words “Grandma and Grandpa” in the title and has been falsely reported as “incest porn” when in fact it is only about sexuality between aging partners.[24]</p>
<p>Many observers have noted that the search inventories included many unmarked or hand labeled videos. It’s been speculated that those tapes may contain child pornography but the information has not been released to the public. In fact, some articles on the case have falsely reported that illegal pornography was seized. Possession of child porn in the state of Missouri is a felony carrying up to a 10 year sentence. None of the men have been charged with this or any other offense resulting from the searches. Despite the wide assortment of accusations, the men are charged only with the crimes in which no physical evidence would necessarily be expected.</p>
<p><strong><em>“They were distinguished for ignorance for they had just one idea and that was wrong.”</em></strong> &#8211; Benjamin Disraeli</p>
<p>When asked where the accusing Mohler siblings reside, Sheriff Alumbaugh states that they are<em> “from all over right now”</em>.[7] While this is true, the primary accuser resides in the college town of Provo, Utah and two other siblings show previous addresses in Provo. Provo, Utah is home to the Brigham Young University, run by the LDS Church. For a city of only 42 square miles, it has seen more than its share of repressed memory scandals. <em>“Following a single article in the Provo weekly paper [about the <a title="False Memory Syndrome Foundation online" href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/" target="_blank">FMS Foundation</a>], in three days, over 150 families in this single geographical area called to report their experience.”</em> Institute for Psychological Therapies, 1992</p>
<p>The student Counseling Center at BYU offers therapy to students for abuse issues. The Center’s website asserts, “Some individuals have little or no memory of being sexually abused and its impact upon them until adulthood.” [25] The Center also recommends books by repressed-memory therapists, Lynn Finney, Beverly Engel, and Noemi Mattis, as suggested reading. <em>“The authors of these books all rely on the one another&#8217;s work as supporting evidence for their work; they all endorse and recommend one another&#8217;s books to their readers. If one of them comes up with a concocted statistic &#8212; such as &#8216;more than half of all women are victims of childhood sexual trauma&#8217; &#8212; the numbers are traded like baseball cards, reprinted in every book and eventually enshrined as fact. Thus the cycle of misinformation, faulty statistics and invalidated assertions maintains itself&#8230;.&#8221;</em> -Carol Tavris</p>
<p>Lynn Finney is known for her promotion of self-hypnosis to recover memories of abuse, and for her belief that fully one-third of all women have been victims. In fact, Finney’s one-third statistic leads BYU Counseling Center’s website page for students seeking therapy.[25] One of Finney’s former patients, Martha Beck, authored the 2005 book <em>Leaving the Saints</em>. Beck is a Provo native, a therapist, and past professor of Sociology at BYU. It was while teaching at BYU, that Beck recovered memories of ritual abuse. In her book, Beck brags of her cruel confrontation with her 90 year old ailing father, <em>&#8220;I grin, but my father is not amused. He looks longingly toward the hotel room door, apparently realizing I&#8217;m not about to let him leave.”</em> [26] All seven of Beck’s siblings have expressed outrage and condemned these allegations.</p>
<p>Beverly Engel espouses, <em>“If you still have a hard time believing a survivor…look at your own history for signs that you yourself may have been abused and are in denial”</em> Engel gives a list of symptoms to assist the reader in determining if they have been abused and are in denial. Those symptoms include:  feeling ugly; a tendency to apologize; feeling helpless; or problems in relationships.[27]</p>
<p>Also recommended by the BYU Counseling Center is the 1993 publication <em>Confronting Abuse</em>.[25][28] Compiled by three Brigham Young University professors,<em> Confronting Abuse</em> is a collection of essays on ritual and sexual abuse. In it, repressed-memory practitioner, Neomi Mattis, describes the abuse she’s helped her patients to uncover: <em>&#8220;In addition to all combinations of sexual intercourse genital, anal, and oral between child and adult or child and child (forced), victims are penetrated genitally or rectally with all kinds of objects, and are forced to submit to sexual activity with animals”. &#8220;They are forced to participate in all of the crimes, including sacrifice of animals; the torture and sometimes murder of babies, including in some cases the infants of young girls required to bear children specifically for sacrifice; the torture and sometimes murder of adults; and the systematic disposal of bodies.”</em> Mattis explains why evidence of these crimes is never found, despite in-depth investigations: <em> “Cultists include professionals, such as morticians and butchers, who are skilled at disposing of evidence.”</em> She goes on to explain why many of the reports are verifiably false, <em>“The victims are programmed to dissociate, so that they do not recognize or remember parts of their own experience or personality. They are trained to deny accusations, tell conflicting stories and retract their own reports”</em>.  As for the seemingly normal, often charitable, outward lives of the accused in these child-rapes, breedings, murders, and torture, Mattis offers this, <em>“[The Perpetrators are also]dissociative and thus unaware of their other cult-involved selves.&#8221;</em> [29] (*See footnote) By this logic, any one of us could be not only victims, but also perpetrators of these crimes and never know it.</p>
<p>Just eight miles outside of Provo, the infamous “<a title="The Greenbaum Speech" href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/hammond.html" target="_blank">Greenbaum</a>” [30] lecturer, Corydon Hammond operates a therapy office. In 2004, Hammond, along with Bennett Braun and Roberta Sachs of Chicago, settled a malpractice lawsuit against them by retracting repressed-memory patient Elizabeth Gale.  Hammond paid $175,000 of that $7.5M settlement.</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I&#8217;m not sure about the universe.”</em></strong> – Albert Einstein</p>
<p>It seems to be the perfect storm: A divorce with bitter custodial parent; the repressed-memory pied pipers of Provo; a lead investigator with an agenda; a newly appointed prosecutor who has specialized in sexual abuse cases; and regular sensationalist misinformation distributed in the media. Having made the allegations so public and over-extending county monies on the investigation, the likelihood that the charges will be dropped due to the lack of hard evidence is greatly lessened.</p>
<p>An entire generation has come up since the hysteria of the 1980’s and early 1990’s. We saw then how easily the hysteria spreads from one sibling to the next, to investigators, prosecutors, child services, the media, and to the public. Each points to the other as evidence that their beliefs are reasonable. At that time, it was daytime talk shows like Sally Jesse Raphael or Phil Donahue that disseminated these shocking tales to gullible audiences. Today, the internet has taken the place of those talk shows and it seems that audiences are just as gullible.</p>
<p>*Footnote:<br />
A 1995 study found that in cases of alleged abuse with no claims of repression or amnesia by the accusers, only 22% of accused passed polygraphs.  In cases where accusers claimed a period of amnesia, 91% of accused passed polygraphs. [29]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not Exonerated Quite Yet: An update on Missouri Mohler case</span></strong><br />
by J. Bean (A skeptic in KC)</p>
<p>The arrests in the fall of 2009 of Burrell Mohler Sr., his brother, and his four sons stunned Western Missouri residents.   On Friday, February 17, 2012, the community was again taken off-guard as Burrell Sr.’s impossibly high bond was reduced, then waved, releasing him from jail to  await a trial, still many months away.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2009 Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh, along with prosecutor Kellie Ritchie-Campbell, held a press conference, announcing the arrests of the Mohler men on charges that they had repeatedly sexually assaulted several young relatives during the 1980’s.   In the weeks following that press conference, information and speculations from authorities continued to be shared with the media.</p>
<p>Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the media frenzy came to a halt.  Questions as to why no charges were filed on any of the allegations which should have produced physical evidence went unanswered, as were questions as to why it’s taken over 20 years for the victims to come forward.   Now, the community is left with another mystery:  What has happened in the cases which would cause a judge to release the accused without posting bond?</p>
<p>Since his arrest, the legal wranglings in the case of Burrell Mohler Sr. have all centered around discovery &#8211; specifically the production of diaries and medical/therapy records.  The state&#8217;s primary justification for not producing these in the past two years has been that the alleged victims were stunned and terrified due to “unexpected” media attention.  The defense has pointed out that the only media attention the case received was immediately following the state&#8217;s calling of a press conference.   As soon as defense counsel was retained, the media blitz stopped.</p>
<p>In December 2011, a special appointed discovery judge issued a 30 day final deadline for the lists of physician names to be provided for subpoena.   Still nothing happened.   Burrell&#8217;s attorney filed a motion for sanctions, to be heard on Feb 17th.</p>
<p>In the weeks following the filing of that motion, there was a sudden flurry of activity, the accusers finally providing names of physicians and other materials.  On Wednesday, Feb 15th, the alleged victims made a statement to the Associated Press, which read in part:  &#8220;After four years of cooperating with the prosecution, we believe that a just and speedy trial can be reached without further compromising our privacy and safety&#8221;.   Due to this announcement, several media outlets noted the motion to be heard on Friday.</p>
<p>Friday at 10am there was a packed courtroom, as usual, on the side of the defense.  For the first time in over two years, there were also a few seats occupied on the side of the state &#8211; not supporters of the state, but members of the press.</p>
<p>Oral arguments began with Attorney Kim Benjamin reviewing the two years of attempts in obtaining necessary discovery.   She told of the original complaint having been brought to and investigated by neighboring Jackson County, with no charges filed.  The complaint was then taken to Lafayette County and the men immediately arrested and charged based on the victim statements alone. Only then did that county begin its investigation.</p>
<p>Attorney Benjamin showed color glossy photos of the original press conference, with the DA herself standing next to a chart which clearly identified the alleged victims as the children of Ed Mohler. Ms. Benjamin told of the allegations, made but not charged, of satanic rituals, severed heads floating down rivers, child prostitution as preschoolers, and live births at the ages of ten or eleven.  She said the state had denied this was a case of repressed memory, then read a quote from one of the first communications ever given to authorities, in which one of the accusers asserts she was the first of the siblings <em>“to have adult memories of our childhood abuse”</em>, only a few years ago. She explained how easily the defense was able to connect the accusers with a group of pet psychics and massage therapists who claim to be able to bring hidden memories out of your body cells.</p>
<p>The prosecutor admitted that it is a case of repressed and recently recovered memories, saying she’d never told attorneys differently.  She said she did not have control over the press conference, and spoke of the re-victimization of rape victims by having to hand over personal records.   She stressed that many records have been provided in the past couple of weeks.   The discovery judge, Hon. Michael Maloney, confirmed that he had recently received several thousand pages of materials.   In proceedings later in the day, he took the bench, and expressed some dismay that it is the defense, rather than the prosecution, seeking these and other records, as the state should have sought them in order to prove its case noting, <em>“The results of the alleged abuse would certainly have required critical care”</em>.</p>
<p>Burrell Sr.’s attorney reiterated that the appropriate time for the state’s investigation should have been prior to the arrests, rather than arrest first, and now attempting to gather the required evidence two and a half years later.  She argued that it&#8217;s not a matter of <em>&#8220;what have you done for me lately&#8221;</em>, but a matter of her client rotting in jail, while counsel has still not received a single page of this discovery.</p>
<p>Judge Harmon denied the motion for sanctions or dismissal.  Then, without it having even been asked, ordered Burrell Sr. released on his own recognizance.  The state asked there be a condition that he cannot be around children under the age of 17, which the court rejected.</p>
<p>Burrell&#8217;s hearing aid wasn&#8217;t working, so he had no reaction.  As the family broke into tears of joy and relief, Ms. Benjamin penned him a note saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father of the accusers, Ed Mohler, awaits in jail in another county.  No similar motions have yet been filed by his public defender.</p>
<p>Burrell’s brother, defendant Darrel Mohler passed away in October, and thus will never hear of his accusers’ announcement that they are now ready to provide him a just and speedy trial.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">In<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022572"> a paper</a> published 27 July [1], researchers from MIT reported successful tests in mice with a new drug that holds the promise of being a cure to<em> all </em>viruses. The drug, DRACO (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>ouble-stranded <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>NA <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ctivated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>aspase <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span>ligomerizer), works as a &#8220;broad-spectrum&#8221; antiviral, killing virus-hijacked cells by targeting double-stranded RNA produced in the viral replication process. DRACO proved successful against all 15 viruses tested &#8220;including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, H1N1 influenza, a stomach virus, a polio virus, dengue fever and several other types of hemorrhagic fever.&#8221; [2]<span id="more-841"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We may expect results from cell trials against AIDS within the next 12 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">DRACO is but one broad-spectrum therapeutic being developed as part of a project called PANACEA (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>harmacological <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ugmentation of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span>onspecific <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>nti-pathogen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>ellular <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>nzymes and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ctivities) headed by Dr. Todd Rider, senior staff scientist in MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#8217;s Chemical, Biological, and Nanoscale Technologies Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I met with Dr. Rider in the food court of the MIT co-op bookstore early on a weekday. He had already finished tending to his mice and, after we chatted, he rose to declare that he was off to do &#8220;<em>real</em> work&#8221;&#8230; writing grant proposals to keep his research alive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Could you give us a broad overview of the Panacea project?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We&#8217;ve come up with a broad-spectrum antiviral that we call DRACO, Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizer (I love acronyms), and it&#8217;s basically designed to detect any long double stranded RNA, so we&#8217;ve created chimeric proteins where one end will detect the chimeric RNA &#8212; the double-stranded RNA &#8212; and then the other end will trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide. So the net effect is that these DRACO molecules can go inside all the cells in your body, or at this moment, inside all the cells in a mouse, and if they don&#8217;t find anything, then they don&#8217;t do anything. But if they find a viral infection, if they find a viral double-stranded RNA, then that will activate the back ends to trigger cell suicide, and that will kill the infected cell. That terminates the infection.</p>
<p><strong>So there wouldn&#8217;t be a difference between DNA Viruses and RNA Viruses?</strong></p>
<p>It works with both. We&#8217;ve tested it on both. All known viruses make double-stranded RNA, and that&#8217;s true from the literature and also true from our experiments. So here (indicating illustration) the viruses we tested included a couple DNA viruses, and it worked quite nicely against those. Others in the literature are also known to make quite a bit of double-stranded RNA. Other DNA viruses, like pox viruses and herpes viruses, also make double-stranded RNA.</p>
<p><strong>Has it been tested on each family of virus?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been tested on these families of viruses so far (indicating paper). There are a gazillion viruses, so we&#8217;re working our way through them as quickly as we can. It&#8217;s been tested on several very different families so far.</p>
<p><strong>My understanding is that viruses usually kill the cell anyway, but retroviruses usually do not. I don&#8217;t know how viruses cluster. Are there any odds at all that there would be a retrovirus that clusters too tightly in a certain organ where it [triggered cell death by DRACO] would cause a lesion?</strong></p>
<p>Virtually <em>all</em> viruses will kill the host cell on the way out. Of the hand-full that don&#8217;t, your own immune system will try to kill those infected cells. So we&#8217;re really not killing any more cells with our appraoch than we already have been. It&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re killing them at an early enough stage before they infect and ultimately kill more cells. So if anything this limits the amount of cell death.</p>
<p><strong>So that&#8217;s not really a legitimate fear.</strong></p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p><strong>How far along are you and how far away are you from human trials?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately quite a long way. We&#8217;ve done a number of tests in mice. We need to do more testing in mice. Of course, MIT is not a pharmaceutical company. There&#8217;s only so far we can take it at MIT. We&#8217;re hoping to license it to some pharmaceutical company, and they would carry to larger-scale animal trials. Usually the FDA wants to see a lot of mouse trials, which we&#8217;ve done already; and then a lot of trials in, say, rabbits or guinea pigs, and then trials in monkeys before they approve human trials. So, if a licensee takes this, if we have funding for it, it still might take a decade or so before it really is available for humans.</p>
<p><strong>So how&#8217;s the funding working now?</strong></p>
<p>We have funding from NIH [National Institutes of Health].</p>
<p><strong>And can you take it up to monkey here [at MIT]?</strong></p>
<p>We may be able to take it into further animal models here, but mice are the easiest thing to use. We have a lot of mice. We&#8217;re also limited by funding. We only haved NIH funding at the moment, and we only have enough funding for about 1 person, and we have 4 people total, counting me, working at the moment, so we&#8217;ve split the funding four different ways&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Has anybody reached out to you?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. Not so far.</p>
<p><strong>When I first read about this I thought this was an amazing story, that this would be front-page news in a couple of hours. Weeks later, I was thinking this must not have been a true story. That&#8217;s when I looked it up again and saw that it was indeed on the MIT site. What&#8217;s the relative lack of interest. There haved been articles, but I feel this is definitely front-page material.</strong></p>
<p>Well thank you. On the funding front, I think there&#8217;s a ton of funding for very basic research &#8212; not applied research, trying to cure something, but basic research &#8212; Let&#8217;s go study this virus, see how this virus works in a little more detail. There&#8217;s a ton of NIH funding for that. On the applied front, if you are ready for human trials &#8212; so you&#8217;re 10 years more advanced than we are now &#8212; then there are government agencies and companies that will take it and take it to that final step. But in that long gap in between there&#8217;s very very little funding out there. So we&#8217;ve been struggling for all of 11 years now just working to get funding, and at the moment we&#8217;re just barely limping along.</p>
<p><strong>This is a subset of PANACEA, right? Can you describe PANACEA?</strong></p>
<p>PANACEA is a family of broad-spectrum anti-pathogen treatments. We&#8217;ve tested some others, we&#8217;ve tried to get funding for others. This [DRACO] is the one that is furthest along.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the others that look promising?</strong></p>
<p>We have a number of others. [DRACO] is a broad-spectrum antiviral. We have other broad-spectrum antivirals. We also have other PANACEA treatments that we&#8217;ve adapted to go after other things. Like for bacteria. And of course there are antibiotics, but for bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics, such as tuberculosis, malaria&#8230; so we can adapt this to pathogens other than viruses. We&#8217;ve done some initial experiments, we just can&#8217;t get funding for that so far.</p>
<p><strong>Do you foresee any potential wild-cards in the human trials?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always difficult to tell what will happen. I hope that there won&#8217;t be. We&#8217;re always concerned that there will be some toxicity or other unforeseen problems. We&#8217;ve been very pleased every step of the way in the cell testing. We&#8217;ve tested in a number of different human cell types representing many different organs; human lung cells, human liver cells, all kinds of different human cells, as well as a variety of animal cells. We haven&#8217;t seen any toxicity or any other strange effects in any of those cell types. In the mice we were again very concerned about toxicity, and we haven&#8217;t seen any toxicity in the mice. We inject the mice with very high doses of the stuff daily for a number of days, and they seem fine. We let them move for a while, eventually we dissected them, looked at the tissues. All the tissues were fine, there&#8217;s no organ damage or anything. It&#8217;s always possible something unexpected could come up further down the road in monkies or in humans. We certainly hope not. But I think there is enough flexibility in the concept that even if there were a problem, there are ways to redesign the constructs that we have to overcome any potential problems.</p>
<p><strong>That might also speak to the production cost. Is it fairly low production cost if, say, it was to be mass-produced in the future?</strong></p>
<p>These are produced in bacteria, and at the moment I really don&#8217;t know what the ultimate production cost would be. We produce on a very small scale, barely enough for our mice. Of course cells eat a lot less DRACO than mice do. So if we&#8217;re producing for cells, that&#8217;s a very small quantity, but just a few flasks of bacteria will produce enough to last us for a while. But once you scale this up to a large-scale production large-scale animal trials or human trials, hopefully the cost would go down. I don&#8217;t know exactly what the cost would be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you envision the final end-plan to be people with DRACO in their medicine cabinet, or more like penicillin today?</strong></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s safe I&#8217;d like to see it used as much as possible for as many different things as possible. I would guess that if it were approved for human use by the FDA, initially they would be conservative enough that they would only want to see it used in very dire cases, just in case there are interesting side-effects or something, and it&#8217;s only to people with ebola or HIV that&#8217;s become resistant to other drugs who would get this. If this proved to be safe in those cases, then I would hope that they&#8217;d approve it for wider use against more common pathogens, perhaps all the way down to the common cold. And if it really is safe, then maybe you&#8217;d just pop a DRACO pill any time you felt a cold coming on.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it stay in the system? It&#8217;s obviously not a vaccine &#8212;</strong></p>
<p>Right. In cells it lasts at least for a couple of weeks, possibly longer. In the mice it lasts for at least 2 days. We have a lot of data in the paper showing it will persist in mice for at least 48 hours at fairly high doses in the tissues. This is really about trying to optimize that. There are a lot of tricks we can use to try to make it last longer if necessary. And if this stuff is truly completely safe, then you can give it prophylactically. You could even concievably give someone the gene for the DRACO so that their cells would just permanently produce the DRACO, and they would naturally be resistant to almost everything.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, wow. That&#8217;s an amazing idea.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>I feel like this is something that should be fast-tracked. We have all this planning in regards to epidemics. There is all kinds of scare that we&#8217;re ripe for an epidemic.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps we will be [approached with funding offers] in the future, but so far we haven&#8217;t been. We&#8217;ve really struggled along for the past 11 years, barely getting enough funding to stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>So this has been on the table, at least as an idea, for 11 years?</strong></p>
<p>Right. We just got good data from the mouse trials and published that, but 11 years ago we started engineering the DRACOs. Genetic engineering was a bit more primative in those days, so it took us a while to actually produce these things. Then it took us a while to produce and test them in cells. We ultimately tested against 15 different viruses in cells. As I said, we were kind of limping along for funding for much of that time, so we could only work on it when we had funding to work on it. For some fraction of our time, we had funding to work on it. Eventually, we were able to test against the 15 different viruses in cells in 11 different cell types. And then we had funding to do some mouse trials, got data, and then we got published.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a cold this winter&#8230; are you going to be tempted?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not tempted by colds. I&#8217;ve had very bad stomach viruses and I&#8217;ve been tempted to give myself the stuff to see what would happen.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll do that, though?</strong></p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be enough anyway. We only produce enough for mice, and for a human you require a much larger dose than for a 20 gram mouse.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ufocongress.com/tag/2010-ufo-congress/" target="_blank">UFO conference</a> takes a delirious and sour turn with a presentation titled Mind-Control &amp; UFOs: Who’s Really in Charge Here?, presented by a former Indonesian translator for the US State Department, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/us-intelligence-in-national/fred-burks" target="_blank">Fred Burks</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/aboutus#burks" target="_blank">his website</a>, Burks claims to have “interpreted for Bush, Clinton, Gore, Cheney, and many other top officials of the US and other countries. Having participated in numerous secret meetings where the only people allowed were the principals and their interpreters.” Consequently, “he has acquired important inside information and contacts.” It is upon this shaky foundation of credibility &#8212; the idea of the all-access functionary fully briefed upon the darkest, most subterranean state secrets &#8212; that Burks justifies his espousal of a conspiracy theory regarding secret government programs of Ritual Abuse, Mind-Control, and UFO cover-up.<span id="more-809"></span></p>
<p>Not that the conference has proven restrained in speculative leaps till now, what with an early presentation by a woman named <a href="http://dragoninthesky.com/" target="_blank">Ann Eller</a>, who told of her “praying mantis” spirit guide, her visions of extraterrestrial hieroglyphs, and her ability to sense the shape of the UFOs above us with but the power of her intuitive mind alone. Severely limiting her time as a prognosticator, but in keeping with the conference’s catastrophic millenarian subplot, Eller advised us that the end will likely come even before the much-publicized end of the Mayan calendar in 2012&#8230; though she finds credibility in the 2012 doomsday theory that states that a hidden planet, Planet X, “<a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/david-morrison-nibiru-2012.html" target="_blank">Niburu</a>”, will bring upon The End when it collides with Earth.</p>
<p>We also have already heard from a speaker named <a href="http://www.neilfreer.com/" target="_blank">Neil Freer</a> who knows, as items of fact, not only that aliens have indeed been visiting us, but where they came from, their cultural peculiarities, and that they (these “Annunaki”) even manufactured homosapiens in an impetuous little past episode of genetic experimentation. The upshot of this revelation is that the juvenile little Creationist v. Evolution debate of ours is now resolved: “They are both partly correct”, Freer told his (no doubt relieved) audience.</p>
<p>Freer, in a sudden fit of candid lucidity, admitted that his “only basis for credibility here” is the unverifiable claim that he has “been at this” since the age of six&#8230; when he was first abducted by extraterrestrials. Outlandish, to say the least &#8212; But all of this uninhibited free-form folklore is undeniably entertaining.</p>
<p>Burks’s lecture, on the other hand, darkens the carefree stream-of-consciousness mood with its invocation of the terrestrial-based Invisible Hand &#8212; the secretive, highly organized, omnipresent “They” who manipulate world events and individual lives, ever inching themselves nearer to unconcealed and total domination.</p>
<p>Burks informs us that the government has been brainwashing innocent civilians into robotized slaves for use in assassinations and political blackmail plots. Chandra Levy &#8212; the Washington, D.C. Federal Bureau of Prisons intern who, upon investigation of her death in 2001, was found to have been involved in an extramarital affair with then-U.S. representative Gary Condit &#8212; was a blackmail “Manchurian Candidate”, we’re told. Memories are controlled and manipulated through hypnosis. In an instance where you have three witnesses to a UFO&#8230; and they’re each giving conflicting reports&#8230; their memories have probably been hypnotically jumbled regarding the details&#8230; All part of the UFO cover-up. Torture is being used to fracture the psyche’s of unwitting pawns into a controlled and contrived condition of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). There are documents to prove it all.</p>
<p>Reference to the mythic psychiatric diagnosis of MPD is hardly shocking, as it is a common contemporary accessory to the most crass and outrageous of paranoid delusions. Wherever I’ve found MPD, I’ve also found Conspiracy Theory&#8230; sometimes in the background, other times quite out in the open. The theory of MPD holds that some traumas can prove so ruinous to the victim’s psyche that, in order to cope with the reality of it, memory of the trauma is repressed, compartmentalized&#8230; hidden away. The mind is splintered, divided into separate personalities which “recurrently take control of the person&#8217;s behavior&#8221;. Treatment for this condition often relies upon the recovery of these repressed traumatic memories. The victim, it is presumed, must confront these hidden traumas so as to assimilate them into the conscious mind, thereby making the mind &#8220;whole&#8221; again.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of MPD &#8212; despite the suggested conspicuousness of such symptoms &#8212; is said to require the keen and dexterous wit of an experienced expert. Sudden changes in character aren’t always going to be apparent&#8230; No, this condition is a subtle beast. Upon gaining popularity in the 80s, many therapists began to discriminate dim clues to dormant alternative personalities in their clients’ most general manifestations of malaise. <em>Anxiety? Depression? Hmm. Have you considered you may have been raped, only to forget all about it thereafter? To be sure, the memory is still there, it is “repressed” in your unconsciousness mind, exhibiting itself outwardly as this anxiety and depression you’re feeling&#8230;</em></p>
<p>This is a confusing scenario&#8230; no real way to argue against it. Here you presumably have a person in some form of mental distress, willing to submit to the authority of an “expert” to divine the reasons for this dysfunction. The “expert” suggests repressed memories. It’s futile and pointless for one to observe that she has no recollection of what she’s supposed to have forgotten. What’s more, “denial” is a common first response.</p>
<p>From such suspect beginnings, those diagnosed as having MPD may be brought under hypnosis, sodium amytal, guided imagery sessions, or just encouraged to try to remember the traumatic memories hidden within. Fleeting imagery of such scenarios in the mind, bad dreams&#8230; these can signal the surfacing of these memories. Under hypnosis, as an exorcist speaking to parasitic demons within, the therapist accesses the various personalities residing in the fractured individual, culling from them their unique, yet ultimately unified, histories.</p>
<p>It is axiomatic among therapists who subscribe to this recovered memory folly that their presumed “victims” must be believed. So it is that tales of long-running, episodic abuses of the most heinous variety are accepted at face-value, and in the face of lack of corroboration, or even falsifying evidence. This is where conspiracy theories spiral wildly unchecked&#8230; in the therapists office, behind client confidentiality&#8230; the therapist certain something sinister is afoot&#8230; the client trying to produce the right answers&#8230; fabrications and confabulations taken as historical truths&#8230; dis-confirming evidence is evidence of a massive, pervasive, world-engulfing cover-up&#8230;</p>
<p>Most everybody is aware of the idea of an MPD condition, as it has proven an intriguing plot device in good number of Hollywood fictions. Many people are also aware of MPD’s faddish rise in the 1980s, and its role in the “Satanic Panic” modern witch-hunts that resulted as MPD clients claimed to have recovered memories of involvement in horrible cult crimes. Few people, though, seem aware that nothing has really changed since the most public day-care abuse scandals and anti-satanic moral outrages&#8230; No censure of Recovered Memory Therapies from psychiatry’s primary officiating body, The American Psychiatric Association (APA). And despite a lack of scientific evidence in support of MPD as a naturally occurring condition, as opposed to an iatrogenic creation of insidiously coercive therapies &#8212; and against the protests of informed professionals in the field &#8212; the APA also intends to include MPD (under its current branding of “Dissociative Identity Disorder” [DID]) in their revised Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual (DSM), the next edition of which is due out within the next few years.</p>
<p>Worse, delusional therapists espousing vulgar and witless notions of fantasized conspiracies are still quite present, though having been discredited in the mainstream since those halcyon days when they found fleeting favor among daytime television audiences. Organizations like <a href="http://www.process.org/discept/2009/08/25/report-from-the-s-m-a-r-t-ritual-abusemind-control-conference-2009/" target="_blank">S.M.A.R.T.</a> (Stop Mind-control And Ritual abuse Today) &#8212; coordinated by a man who claims to have been a brain-washed victim of the “Masonic/Illuminati” &#8212; host at their annual conferences, and publish in their newsletters, not only licensed therapists you may encounter in the field, but also characters like William Schnoebelen. The remarkable Mr. <a href="http://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/bill-schnoebelen-ufo-aliens-and-nephilim-endtime-attack-on-humanity/" target="_blank">Schnoebelen</a> warns of demonic UFOs, claims to have been a vampire, declares he achieved the rank of 90th degree Freemason, says he was a Satanic High Priest &#8212; even claims to have met Satan himself! &#8212; before awakening to the Glory of Christ. An organization called “Survivorship” (“For survivors of Ritual Abuse, mind control and torture and their allies”) provides on their website a helpful calendar of &#8220;<a href="http://www.survivorship.org/resources/2011dates.html" target="_blank">Difficult Dates</a>&#8221; which lists “satanic, nazi, and polytheistic cult holidays&#8230; compiled from reports by Surviorship members”, as well as advice on how to cope with “government/military mind control (MC)”. Survivorship offers regular professional “webinars” at $50 per session.</p>
<p>Burks, for his unhinged drivel regarding brain-washing and UFO cover-ups is by no means alone in his lunacy.</p>
<p>By the way, Burks also tells us, it turns out that the much-feared <a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/" target="_blank">HAARP</a> (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), for all its talk of “ionospheric research”, is being misused by stir-crazy bunker-bound agents to mischievously alter our very moods and dispositions at random. Burks has felt these sudden mood changes himself. He’s receptive to these devious subtleties. So in tune is he, Fred explains, “I have a connection with beings who are not in bodies.”</p>
<p>He’s sorry to be the one to have to tell us about all of this unpleasantness. Really, he is. Burks reminds us, though, that depraved as their activities are, even these government agents who use ritual torture, methodical forms of trauma-inducing and mind-control-facilitating Satanic abuse&#8230; even they have a heart. <em>Everybody has a heart. Everybody just wants to love and be loved. In fact</em>, Burks digresses, <em>why don’t we take a moment to feel our “heart energy”&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230; Everybody has a heart&#8230;</em></p>
<p>We’re all instructed to breath deeply, in and out slowly, and let out a droning “om”.</p>
<p><em>Very good. Back to business. Time to face up to the savage facts&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Burks dives right in. His presumed evidence comes from records relating to the CIA&#8217;s Cold War era mind-control experiments that began in the 1950s, continuing till at least the late &#8217;60s, under the project name of MK-Ultra. In particular, Burks draws some rather apocalyptic conclusions from a declassified document listed under CIA MORI ID 140401, dated 1 January, 1950 (when MK-Ultra was still known as “Bluebird”), wherein a series of sinister questions are explored:</p>
<blockquote><p>A. Can accurate information be obtained from willing or unwilling individuals?</p>
<p>B. Can Agency-personnel (or persons of interest to this agency) be conditioned to prevent any outside power from obtaining information from them by any known means</p>
<p>C. Can we obtain control of the future activities (physical and mental) of any given individual, willing or unwilling by application of SI [Sleep Induction] and H [Hypnotic] techniques</p>
<p>D. Can we prevent any outside power from gaining, control of future activities (physical and mental) of agency personnel by any known means?</p></blockquote>
<p>And there you have it&#8230;</p>
<p>But while Burks seems to assume that the answer to each of these questions must have been (or eventually became) ‘yes’, the document itself, when one bothers to look at it in its entirety, is more circumspect:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bluebird believes that A (above) can be answered in the affirmative using SI and H techniques. Bluebird Is not fully satisfied with results to date, but believes with continued work and study remarkable and profitable results can be obtained regularly.</p>
<p>However, B, C, and D (above) are as yet unanswerable, although Bluebird is of the opinion that there is a worthwhile chance that all three may at some future date be answered affirmatively. This opinion is supported generally by numerous individuals having knowledge of these techniques and by much literature and intelligence in this field.</p>
<p>Since an affirmative proof of B, C and D would be of incredible value to this agency, Bluebird&#8217;s general problem is to get up, conduct and carry out research (practical &#8211; not theoretical) in this direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up to the Bluebird document above, dated October 1966, and labeled <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/mindcontrol/hypnosisinintelligence.pdf" target="_blank">MORI ID 18252</a> (a document that unfortunately escaped Burks’s attention), the CIA itemized the short-comings that caused them to ultimately adjudge hypnosis worthless as far as military applications are concerned:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Disregarding the difficulties of inducing trance, there is still little assurance that a source can be made to act against his own best interests. A hypnotized subject, even when motivated to be cooperative, often distorts, invents memories, fabricates and otherwise contaminates his output. The more anxious he is about the information, the more likely he is to distort, as a means of defending. He is apt to tell the hypnotist what he wants to hear, whether or not it is related to fact.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This declassified documentary material is available to anybody by way of Freedom Of Information Act request. Curiously, despite Burks’s proclaimed status as a former White House insider, he unveils no new or original material, nor does he provide anecdotes of evil-doings viewed from the inside. No talk of the “important inside information and contacts” directly gained from having “participated in numerous secret meetings where the only people allowed were the principals and their interpreters”. In fact most, if not all, of Burks’s presentation, I recognize in disgust, seems directly derived from a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bluebird-Deliberate-Creation-Personality-Psychiatrists/dp/0970452519" target="_blank"><em>Bluebird: Deliberate Creation of Multiple Personality by Psychiatrists</em></a> written by well-known dissociative disorders psychiatrist, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/underground-in-boston/nightmare-psychiatry-delusions-of-satan-et-abduction-and-the-cultivation-of-false-memories" target="_blank">Colin Ross</a>. Incidentally, but weeks before this lecture, I interviewed <a href="http://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/" target="_blank">a former client of Dr. Colin Ross</a> who felt that her own Multiple Personality Disorder was the creation of a psychiatrist, but she has little doubt that the psychiatrist who created her condition was Dr. Ross himself.</p>
<p>The comment on hypnotic memory recall and false memory fabrication contained in the 1966 document is particularly compelling, as Burks’s (or rather, Ross’s) “evidence” for the conspiracy afoot is at least partly dependent upon narratives produced by subjects who revealed them during hypnotic regression performed in the service of MPD therapy.</p>
<p>In an address to the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple Personality, delivered in 1992, it was an MPD specialist, <a href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/hammond.html" target="_blank">Dr. Corydon Hammond</a>, who elaborated upon the specifics of government brain-washing tactics. His speech, known as “<a href="http://www.raven1.net/grenfull.htm" target="_blank">The Greenbaum Speech</a>” is a classic and influential piece of conspiracy folklore. During the Question &amp; Answer segment following his presentation, Hammond admitted, “There isn&#8217;t great documentation of [this Machurian Candidate program]. It [the evidence] comes from victims who are imperiled witnesses.” But from these “imperiled witnesses”, Hammond managed to dig out repressed memories which outlined some very specific elements, including the meanings of Greek Letter code words used by cult programmers to activate scripted functions in the hapless “Manchurian”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Alphas appear to represent general programming, the first kind of things put in. Betas appear to be sexual programs. For example, how to perform oral sex in a certain way, how to perform sex in rituals, having to do with producing child pornography, directing child pornography, prostitution. Deltas are killers trained in how to kill in ceremonies. There&#8217;ll also be some self-harm stuff mixed in with that, assassination and killing. Thetas are called psychic killers. You know, I had never in my life heard those two terms paired together. I&#8217;d never heard the words &#8220;psychic killers&#8221; put together, but when you have people in different states, including therapists inquiring and asking, &#8220;What is Theta,&#8221; and patients say to them, &#8220;Psychic killers,&#8221; it tends to make one a believer that certain things are very systematic and very widespread. [&#8230;] Then there&#8217;s Omega. [&#8230;] Omega has to do with self-destruct programming. Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. This can include self-mutilation as well as killing-themselves programming. Gamma appears to be system-protection and deception programming which will provide misinformation to you, try to misdirect you, tell you half-truths, protect different things inside. There can also be other Greek letters.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking to therapists, Hammond said, “I&#8217;d recommend that you go and get your entire Greek alphabet&#8230;”</p>
<p>The former patient of Ross’s, whom I interviewed, clearly felt she was swayed toward a Conspiracy Theory-based false recollection of events as Ross probed her mind for evidence of this Greek Alphabet programming:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[&#8230;] my father was in the military. This was when I was a tiny little girl, he was in the Air Force. And for Colin Ross, for anybody who’s ever been in the military, he just makes the immediate leap into CIA, for crying out loud. He asked me if the words – what was it? – ‘beta’… ‘gamma’… and, um… ‘omega’, I think it was [meant anything to me]. Those three. He said that children were put in to CIA experiments where they used goggles on [the children&#8217;s] eyes and hypnotized [them]. [The CIA programmed personalities] were either one of those: beta, omega, alpha, one of those. One [of these designations programmed the child so that they] would commit suicide, one would be given the job to dispense disinformation, the other was [&#8230;] an assassin. I just thought ‘gamma’ sounds too stupid, ‘alpha’ sounds like alphabet soup, for crying out loud, I think I chose Omega, or something like that. I chose the one that sounded the least stupid to me, because I was just trying to cooperate with him. There was just no way you could argue with him. He’d always just twist things around. You couldn’t possibly argue with him. He’d always just say that you fit the description, absolutely fit the description. It has to be this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Claiming to be extremely cautious so a not to “lead the client”, Hammond described how he would probe for answers during hypnosis, saying, &#8220;I want a part inside who knows something about Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Theta to come up to a level where you can speak to me and when you&#8217;re here say, &#8216;I&#8217;m here.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Hammond explained, “I would not ask if a part was willing to [speak]. No one&#8217;s going to particularly want to talk about this. I would just say, &#8220;I want some part who can tell me about this to come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>To what end, one might wonder, is this Extreme Evil being practiced in the face of God-Fearing American Decency©?</p>
<blockquote><p>“My best guess is that the purpose of it is that they [the satanists] want an army of Manchurian candidates — tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, do child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, all sorts of lucrative things and do their bidding. And eventually, the megalomaniacs at the top believe, [they will] create a satanic order that will rule the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the foul witch-hunting core of conspiracist speculation, and the narrative of government programs of Ritual Abuse/Mind-Control is but the evil twin of Alien Abduction folklore. Not only are both largely dependent upon the presumed reliability of “recovered memories”, but both contain many of the same plot elements&#8230; elements that appear to be universal, archetypal, to the entranced ramblings from which they are derived. Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Gwen L. Dean, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alien-Discussions-Proceedings-Abduction-Conference/dp/0964491702/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298782748&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">compiled an exhausting list</a> of such parallels, among which we find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Abductees and victims of Ritual Abuse recall being laid upon a table&#8230; for examination in the case of abductees &#8212; an alter in the Satanic version.</li>
<li>Needles, blades, and high-tech gear are often used by Aliens and Satanists alike.</li>
<li>In both scenarios the victim (or “experiencer”) is likely to view bizarre symbols, occult or other-worldly.</li>
<li>Both Aliens and Satanists are said to use tracking devices on their subjects.</li>
<li>Bright lights initiate the abduction event, while bright lights are used to torture &amp; intimidate Satanic Abuse victims</li>
<li>Restraints are used in both scenarios.</li>
<li>Electrical energy is used to either transfer or erase information in the subjects of both.</li>
<li>There is a notable emphasis on descriptions of eyes that come from the experiencers of each &#8212; the frightening large, black eyes of alien greys, the demonic, inhuman eyes of Satan’s servants on Earth.</li>
<li>Both often report Out-of-Body experiences in relation to their encounters.</li>
<li>Both groups report high occurrences of Visual Disturbances, Sexual Disturbances, Nightmares, Depression, Humiliation, Obsessive Thoughts, Headaches, Sleep Difficulties</li>
<li>Both narratives often have a focus upon genitalia and breeding&#8230; Both Aliens and Satanists are said to take infants.</li>
<li>Aliens and Satanists both seem to know everything about their victim/subject’s life and family, and both Abduction and Ritual Abuse are said to occur in a transgenerationally (meaning they run in the family).</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, believers will point to the broad consistency of these narratives spanning wide geographic areas as evidence that they are based in reality. But a study carried out by a Dr. Alvin H. Lawson in collaboration with Dr. W. C. McCall and John De Herrera showed that the consistency present in alleged alien abductions could also be found in tales of abduction concocted under hypnosis by people with no significant interest in UFOs or ETs. “the <a href="http://www.internetarchaeology.org/6521/SA1.html" target="_blank">Imaginary Abductee study</a>, in which sixteen volunteers were hypnotized and given imaginary UFO or CE3 (for Close Encounters of the Third Kind) abductions” concluded that the “uninformed Imaginary subjects&#8217; narratives contained dozens of detailed and subtle similarities with real CE3 reports, and no significant differences.” Lawson, who was an abduction believer prior to the study, explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We started the Imaginary study with what turned out to be a set of boneheaded assumptions. First, we were nearly certain that the Imaginary narratives would be superficial, vague, and predictable because we thought subjects would be echoing details from media stories, films, and stale UFO lore. Related to that was our second expectation: we were ready to bet the farm that Imaginary abductions would contrast dramatically in particular ways with &#8220;real&#8221; CE3, so that we would eventually learn specifically how to tell hoaxers from actual abductees. Thus we fully expected the Imaginary study to be a kind of touchstone for determining the &#8220;truth&#8221; of CE3 claims.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole thing ultimately made an “informed skeptic” of the doctor. The same study has not, as far as I know, been performed with the Ritual Abuse narrative (and it is unethical, I believe, to attempt it), but I’ve no doubt it would yield the same results.</p>
<p>The parallel between narratives of Ritual Abuse and those involving Alien Abduction was brought to the attention of Dr. Hammond during the Q &amp; A following his “Greenbaum Speech”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: It seems to me that there seems to be some similarity between these kinds of programming and those people who claim that they&#8217;ve been abducted by spaceships and have had themselves physically probed and reprogrammed and all of that sort of thing. Since Cape Canaveral is across the Florida peninsula from me and I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ve reported any spaceships lately, I was just wondering is there any sort of relationship between this and that?</p>
<p>Dr.H: I&#8217;ll share my speculation, that comes from others really. I&#8217;ve not dealt with any of those people. However, I know a therapist that I know and trust and respect who I&#8217;ve informed about all this a couple of years ago and has found it in a lot of patients and so on, who is firmly of the belief that those people are in fact ritual-abuse victims who have been programmed with that sort of thing to destroy all their credibility. If somebody&#8217;s coming in and reporting abduction by a flying saucer who&#8217;s going to believe them on anything else in the future? Also as a kind of thing that can be pointed to and said, &#8220;This is as ridiculous as that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the average Ritual Abuse narrative is not any more plausible than those involving Alien Abduction &#8212; often invoking common Blood Libel accusations, supernatural interventions, and depopulating crimes of mass murder which have managed to remain concealed from the complaisant common folk &#8212; Ritual Abuse conspiracists have benefited from the liberty of being able to withdraw their tales back into a basic framework of real-world components if critical inquiry comes to be too severe. In fact, they often<em> seem</em> willing to abandon their own personal tales of suffered Satanic sexual sadism to circumvent the skeptic’s scrutiny. <em>You doubt that there is an international cult of Satanists that has infiltrated the highest levels of the world’s governments, oppressing the lives of mostly middle-aged, white, American females by secretly traumatizing them into a condition of multiple personalities? Well, you see, that’s just a caricature of our position&#8230; a straw-man&#8230; Really, what we’re saying is uncontroversial &#8212; merely that extreme trauma can result in traumatic amnesia, and that these “repressed memories” may later be recalled with accuracy.</em></p>
<p>You will find that in saying this the Ritual Abuse believer is not, in fact, abandoning the narrative of world-wide Satanic conspiracy. The believer is merely trying to lead you through the proper steps to “understanding”. Once you understand that the premise is sound and scientific &#8212; that repressed memories can be surfaced to divulge uncomfortable historical truths &#8212; you must, then, accept that these stories of Satanic Abuse are on sound footing&#8230; not at all the hysterical ravings you might naively first take them for. Also, you must understand that traumas regarding <em>Child Sexual Abuse</em> are particularly prone to being repressed.</p>
<p>And so, to call “bullshit” on so-called recovered memories of even the most lunatic conspiracies is to find oneself accused of defending pedophilia. In this way, the conspiracy theorist holds victims of actual abuse hostage to his pornographic fantasies, attempting to create an environment in which their untenable claims must be accepted on an equal level with legitimate claims of sexual assault, and to reject one is to deny the other as well.</p>
<p>Hammond’s assertion that Alien Abduction narratives can be implanted to discredit true tales of Ritual Abuse raises a whole other series of questions, whether one believes in a Satanic conspiracy or not. Could Hammond, or any other therapist, reliably distinguish true memories of abuse from the possibility of more plausible “screen memories” that don’t involve aliens? And if one can invoke this type of false memory to explain away Alien Abduction, the idea of a False Memory Syndrome surely mustn’t sound too entirely preposterous …Though the words “False Memory Syndrome” are often enough to provoke stammering, convulsive protests from Satanic Abuse believers.</p>
<p>The idea of a False Memory Syndrome was put forward by an organization started by a “group of families and professionals affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution in Baltimore [&#8230;] in 1992 because they saw a need for an organization that could document and study the problem of families that were being shattered when adult children suddenly claimed to have recovered repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse.” Their website explains, “Across the country, parents had been reporting that they had received phone calls and letters accusing them of committing horrifying acts that allegedly had happened decades earlier.” They are called <a href="http://fmsfonline.org/" target="_blank">The False Memory Syndrome Foundation</a> (FMSF), and they describe the condition thus (in a definition penned by one John Kihlstrom):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the memory is distorted, or confabulated, the result can be what has been called the False Memory Syndrome; a condition in which a person&#8217;s identity and interpersonal relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic experience which is objectively false but in which the person strongly believes. Note that the syndrome is not characterized by false memories as such. We all have memories that are inaccurate. Rather, the syndrome may be diagnosed when the memory is so deeply ingrained that it orients the individual&#8217;s entire personality and lifestyle, in turn disrupting all sorts of other adaptive behaviors. The analogy to personality disorder is intentional. False memory syndrome is especially destructive because the person assiduously avoids confrontation with any evidence that might challenge the memory. Thus it takes on a life of its own, encapsulated, and resistant to correction. The person may become so focused on the memory that he or she may be effectively distracted from coping with the real problems in his or her life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Acting as an outreach for those affected by false memories, the FMSF has been instrumental in spreading awareness regarding the potential dangers of digging for repressed memories.</p>
<p>Hammond seemed to agree that traumatic false memories do exist, apparently only disagreeing with the False Memory Syndrome Foundation as to how they are created. While the FMSF asserts that false memories can be created in the course of Recovered Memory Therapies, Hammond suggests that false memories are implanted by Satanic government agents practicing mind-control on unwitting subjects. Other proponents of Recovered Memory accuracy &#8212; appalled and offended that anybody might suggest that such dubious recollections be corroborated when personal liberties of accused parents, or other relations to the alleged victim, are at risk &#8212; disown Satanic Ritual Abuse as readily as Hammond dismissed Alien Abduction&#8230; References to such, if mentioned in the course of debate at all, are seen as but low-brow attempts by crude individuals (such as myself) to discredit all recovered memories. (Oddly enough, though today’s recovered memory defender might disown Hammond’s more obnoxious of lunatic fantasies, they certainly don’t disown Hammond himself, who can still be found in any citation list supporting the notion of repressed memory accuracy &#8212; alongside co-authors Sheflin and Brown.) But the same questions that apply to Hammond apply just as easily to any defender of repressed memory theory. Could any of them distinguish a true memory from a plausible false memory not involving Satanic Abuse or Alien Abduction? Often, the Recovered Memory crowd will deny that traumatic false memories can be created at all, never bothering to explain away the very real evidence that these memories are traumatic to both those who have come to believe in their victimization by either extraterrestrials or Satanists.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/abduction_imagery.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Psychophysiological Responding During Script-Driven Imagery in People Reporting Abduction by Space Aliens</em></a>, Harvard’s Richard J. McNally (et al.) explored the question of whether “recollection of highly improbable traumatic experiences [are] accompanied by psychophysiological responses indicative of intense emotion [.]” That is to say, do people with memories of alien abduction have the same emotional reactions to their false memories as victims of real traumatic events do? The abstract explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To investigate this issue, we measured heart rate, skin conductance, and left lateral frontalis electromyographic responses in individuals who reported having been abducted by space aliens. Recordings of these participants were made during script-driven imagery of their reported alien encounters and of other stressful, positive, and neutral experiences they reported. We also measured the psychophysiological responses of control participants while they heard the scripts of the abductees. We predicted that if ‘‘memories’’ of alien abduction function like highly stressful memories, then psychophysiological reactivity to the abduction and stressful scripts would be greater than reactivity to the positive and neutral scripts, and this effect would be more pronounced among abductees than among control participants.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Relative to control participants,&#8221; McNally and his team concluded, &#8220;abductees exhibited greater psychophysiological reactivity to abduction and stressful scripts than to positive and neutral scripts.&#8221; The abductees&#8217; responses, it turned out, were even comparable to those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients who had listened to scripts of their actual traumatic experiences. Clearly, the abduction phenomenon poses a unique challenge to those who insist upon recovered memory validity, deny the existence of traumatic false memories, yet disregard stories involving ETs.</p>
<p>But, of course, Burks has none of the aversion to Abduction tales that Hammond expressed following his Greenbaum Speech. Eventually, we even hear from <a href="http://www.aztecufo.com/speakers/NiaraIsley.htm" target="_blank">one of his Ritual Abuse/Mind-Control victims </a>who recounts an event in which she was gang-raped by military personnel in an underground bunker while bemused grey aliens half-heartedly observed.</p>
<p>During the Question &amp; Answer session following Burks’s presentation, I approach the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doug: Do you feel the False Memory Syndrome Foundation works directly with MK-Ultra to cover-up mind-control?</p>
<p>Fred: Yup. Thank you. I&#8217;m fairly certain the False Memory Foundation IS part of the cover-up. (applause)&#8230;and it is not people who just (indistinguishable). So I would not trust most the things &#8211; now some of those people DON&#8217;T EVEN KNOW that they&#8217;re being manipulated. That&#8217;s important to realize. They&#8217;re not all of them consciously in with the power elite. It&#8217;s really important to recognize that, that they&#8217;ve been misled into trying to debunk stuff that is actually real.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a sizeable smattering of indignant applause. At first, I’m only a bit disconcerted to note the number of people who seem to hold the FMSF in bitter contempt. The conference room fits a couple hundred people, about a quarter of which apparently understand my question well enough to applaud it. Slowly, I feel panicked horror begin to over-take me. I suddenly feel surrounded by irrational moral crusaders&#8230; witch-hunters. I shall be marked as one with Satanic loyalties to dark, hidden societies &#8211; hell-bent on discrediting the research, and besmearing the names, of all those who threaten to reveal the process and purpose of this hideous mind-control plot &#8212; if I speak my opinion to any of them.</p>
<p>It seems not to matter how many retractors tell of the irresponsible therapy that had once convinced them of False Memory narratives that were demonstrably untrue. They are but agents of disinformation sent out to conceal the tragic truth of Satanic Ritual Abuse and Alien Abduction. It matters not the studies by respectable scientific researchers that demonstrate the unreliability of recovered memories and the relative ease with which false memories, even unpleasant or traumatic ones, may be planted. Doctors Loftus, McHugh, Pope, McNally, et al. &#8211; all of them part of the cover-up. Are their studies reproducible? Doesn&#8217;t matter. Disregard them. These studies, their data, are but Satanic propaganda with the power to pollute the mind, clever and insidious misinformation constructed to fool even the critical elite within the UFO Congress.</p>
<p>And one&#8217;s very presence at the UFO Congress conference is enough to assure that they may be counted among the critical elite. We at the conference could see through the media&#8217;s government sponsored lies and disinformation. This fact alone, the fact that these conference goers knew well enough to see past the foul lies and accept the fact of ET activity on our own planet, made them experts in various other fields in which they had no formal training. Many speakers appeal to the intuitive expertise of this outsider elite in their lectures. Several times we are shown images of what is now known as the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hrWjkn_DHs" target="_blank">Norwegian Spiral</a>&#8220;, video footage of a misfired Russian missile over Norway on December 13, 2009. The missile fired into the atmosphere during the night leaving striking blue luminous contrails and a wide spiral of leaked jet-fuel in its wake. The effect was spectacular, the images and video can be easily be found online. The effect was so striking, in fact, it could not possibly be but the image of a wayward missile. Surely, a more rational explanation &#8211; despite the fact that the Russians fully own-up to the mis-fire &#8211; is that an inter-dimensional portal was temporarily opened, by extraterrestrials, over Norway. <em>Does that <strong>look</strong> like a missile to you?</em> We are more than once asked. Many laugh at the absurdity of the missile theory. Of course, I seriously doubt that any of them had actually previously witnessed a missile mis-fire against which the Norwegian Spiral could be compared.</p>
<p>Days after his lecture, I approach Burks in the conference room. Unlike the other Ritual Abuse enthusiasts I’ve encountered, Fred Burks seems remarkably amiable and approachable. A friendly fellow, I begin to wonder if he isn’t just a well-meaning buffoon who hasn’t simply been misled. I ask if he has had any personal contact with the conspiracy-mongering Dr. Ross. Ross, as I suspected, is a hero to Burks, who reported that he has tried repeatedly to contact Ross. Ross&#8217;s failure to reply, Burks speculates, is due to an offending email that Burks had sent him asking for confirmation &#8211; citation &#8211; for a claim made in Bluebird. &#8220;I asked him for citation for a line in Bluebird that claimed that children were used in [MK-Ultra] experiments. I don&#8217;t think he had it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Ross, I explained to Fred Burks, has problems of his own at the moment. Then I smart-assedly directed Burks to a website containing <a href="http://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/" target="_blank">&#8220;some guy&#8217;s&#8221; article</a> exposing staggering malpractice claims against Ross. Of course, the article was my own, but I sincerely wondered what Burks would make of the well-documented accusations supported by sworn affidavits and professional testimony. He was unshaken. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised [Ross] doesn&#8217;t get more trouble like this,&#8221; he commented. The article, it seemed, could be dismissed as a mere &#8220;attack&#8221; &#8211; not to be considered credible, no matter what sources the article cited.</p>
<p>Very well, then. How about that Greenbaum Speech, eh?</p>
<p>Burks describes the Greenbaum Speech as “amazing”, and I have to agree. We’re both utterly stricken by the speech in our own ways.</p>
<p>I ask Burks if he is aware of the works of famed hypnotist <a href="http://www.erickson-foundation.org/" target="_blank">Milton Erickson</a> and, in particular, Erickson’s many attempts, and failures, to achieve high-level mind-control in his clients. (That is to say, Erickson was unable to make them react in ways they believed would bring harm unto themselves or otherwise respond well-outside their moral boundaries.)</p>
<p>Yes, Burks is aware of Erickson, but he is not at all sure how much Erickson <em>really knew</em>. Then, creepily, Burks mentions the amazing power that Erickson must have wielded over his female clients, suggesting that he must have taken full advantage of that situation, because, “Hey, face it. Any normal man would.”</p>
<p>I’m not at all sure what to make of this, so I just shake his hand and we part ways.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I find myself in the hotel bar with a group of abductees. My fear that everybody will descend upon me and have me burned at a stake has abated, and I’m having easy conversation over some drinks in a low-lit obscure, comfortable corner. My abductee society are amiable, easy to speak to. I feel less like an interloping undercover skeptic, and more like just another conference-goer with his own unique opinion.</p>
<p>“What do you think of the whole 2012 thing?” the fellow on my left asks.</p>
<p>I see no need to pretend I find merit in this particular doomsday scenario. I shrug and grimace. Before I say anything, he says, “Doesn’t seem like you give it much credit.”</p>
<p>“Well&#8230;” I say, doing my best to sound diplomatic, “The problem is that, in my life-time alone, so many Ends-of-the-World have come and gone&#8230;”</p>
<p>He nods as his features are overcome with intrigue. “That’s interesting&#8230; so, you’ve experienced the End of the World before&#8230;!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*********</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The graph below is from the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (Psychother Psychosom 2006;75:19-24), Tracking Scientific Interest in the Dissociative Disorders: A Study of Scientific Publication Output 1984 &#8211; 2003; Harrison G. Pope Jr., Steven Barry, Alexander Bodkin, James I. Hudson</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the abstract: &#8220;Using a standard medical index, PsycINFO, we counted the number of indexed publications involving dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder listed for each year. We then compared these rates with those of well-established diagnoses [&#8230;]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder have not generated consistent scientific interest over the years, but instead apparently enjoyed a brief period of fashion that now has waned.  Overall, our observations suggest that these diagnostic entities presently do not command widespread scientific acceptance.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having entered the hotel slightly after the opening speaker of S.M.A.R.T.’s twelfth annual Ritual Abuse, Secretive Organizations, and Mind-Control conference began, I was told by a large woman sitting behind the registration table that I would have to wait until I could be properly registered before entering.  I took a seat just outside the open door of the conference room where I could observe the full proceedings within.  Brick stood at the podium.  He is a “small man in his 50s with a greasy dark curly comb-over, large thick glasses, and a voice that sounds exacly like Elmer Fudd (without the impediment of pronouncing his Rs as Ws).”</p></div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">He was delivering the opening remarks.  He was wearing a button-up shirt at least two sizes too large for his diminutive frame.  Reading directly from his notes in a mechanical word-by-word monotone, without once looking up, he emotionlessly railed against skeptics who have sought to discredit ritual abuse as well as the validity of &#8220;recovered memories&#8221;.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">&#8220;There is overwhelming scientific evidence that recovered memory exists as a phenomenon&#8221;, he asserted.  He began to quote at length from sources that agree with this position.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">A belief in the historical accuracy of recovered memories, as I had already discerned from their website, is vital to S.M.A.R.T.&#8217;s belief in a conspiracy of satanic cults and government mind-control.  The theory espoused by recovered memory proponents (and well known in popular culture), is that traumatic memories of abuse may be repressed &#8211; relegated to some dark corner of the mind &#8211; where they unfailingly metastasize into some type of chronic negative emotions, compulsions, confusion, even physical ailments.  Preserved in high-definition, and unerring detail, these oppressive unconscious memories must be drawn out, retrieved, relived, confronted, and reconciled within the conscious mind, before the victim can lead a happy and productive life.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Almost all of the self-proclaimed victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse have recovered their memories of victimization while undergoing some type of psychotherapy.  For the most part, these memories are the only type of “evidence” they attempt to present in support of the claim that such victimization ever occurred.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">The process of digging for repressed traumatic memories through hypnosis or other techniques is most often employed in treatment of the diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now re-labeled as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in the American Psychiatric Association&#8217;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).  Due to their almost total reliance upon recovered memory evidence, purveyors of satanic cult stories are often also defenders of the controversial multiple personality diagnosis, a condition that itself is dismissed by some psychiatrists and psychologists as a &#8220;behavioral artifact&#8230; generated by suggestion in vulnerable people.&#8221; (See below: Concerned Psychiatrists&#8217; and Psychologists&#8217; letter to the APA&#8217;s DSM-V Task Force.)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Critics of Recovered Memory Therapy point out that the act of digging for memories assumed to be repressed can have a subtly coercive effect on clients who &#8211; knowing what they are supposed to be &#8220;remembering&#8221; &#8211; are at least as prone to confabulating false memories as they are to recalling anything with historical accuracy.  Given that such critics of recovered memory therapy often point directly to highly improbable claims of satanic cult abuse as evidence of false memories, it was no surprise that Neil Brick breezily dismissed skeptics as conspirators: &#8220;There is [&#8230;] a lot of evidence that those attacking the theory of recovered memory may have ulterior motives.  For example, they may have been accused of child abuse crimes or may have been connected to mind control research in the past.&#8221;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Using &#8220;child abuse&#8221; interchangeably with &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221;, Brick attempted to further bolster a position that those who doubt the existence of an international brain-washing coven simply despise tykes: &#8220;The media turned on child abuse survivors in the early and mid 1990′s and began to in essence support those that has [sic] perpetrated crimes against children, believing unfounded stories about so called &#8216;miscarriages of justice.&#8217; Due to the extreme nature of ritual abuse crimes and the psychological need for the public denial of these crimes, it became an easy sell to spin these crimes against children for the public to believe the misstatements about falsely accused perpetrators. After ritual abuse was discredited, then other child abuse crimes could be more easily discredited.&#8221;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">There you have it.  You’re either with Neil Brick, or you’re with the Satanists.  You either believe every outrageous claim of demonic doings, or you’re part of the cover-up.  At best, you’re simply in “denial”.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Suddenly, the woman at the registration table, who had also been watching Neil Brick through the open door, began to lightly sob.  She grabbed a nearby tissue, dried her eyes, and blew her nose.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I stared uncomfortably down at the program in my hands.  I came looking for the reasons, the so-called evidence that compels this continued belief in satanic cult crimes&#8230; of mind control&#8230; to see the self-proclaimed byproducts of the brutal puppet masters said to control the highest reaches of the world governments with an inhuman disdain for life and liberty.  Instead &#8211; with scheduled lectures entitled &#8220;Dissociation and Time Management&#8221; and &#8220;The DID RA [Ritual Abuse] Family: An Attachment Perspective on a Forensic Relationship&#8221; &#8211; this conference appeared to be primarily adapted toward defending the DID diagnosis.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">According to his biographical synopsis on the program, Neil Brick describes himself as a “survivor of alleged Masonic Ritual Abuse and MK-ULTRA [the CIA&#8217;s covert mind-control and chemical interrogation project of 1950s &#8211; 60s]“.  The disclaimer of the word “alleged” in his own biographical description is perplexing&#8230;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I mulled over this as Brick eventually concluded his labored lecture.  What did it mean?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Brick comes out to the registration table during the break following his presentation gripping a briefcase.  He scrutinized me momentarily.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I checked out.  Given the nod, my attendance was then officially approved.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I stationed myself anonymously in the second to last occupied row at the far left side of the room.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Never, it occurred to me, have I heard anybody describe oneself as an &#8220;alleged victim of a mugging&#8221;, nor would I expect one to tell me, &#8220;I was allegedly harassed by a drunkard last night&#8221;.  Considering this, I wondered if perhaps Neil Brick himself is uncertain as to whether or not he was a victim of the CIA or Masonic abuse.  In fact, despite a veneer of confident assurance that the satanic conspiracy is an unquestionable item of fact, the conference was rife with inconsistency and an undercurrent of doubt&#8230;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Anyway, it was the inconsistent, and wildly incredible, content of the conference that I focused on in my writing.  And this was no mere point-and-laugh tactic for the amusement of those who cultivate an air of superiority with smug disbelief toward any outside notion.  The conference wasn’t merely absurd, I saw it as harmful and exploitative to the attendees &#8212; many of whom seemed to imagine it as therapeutic &#8212; as well as some of the speakers&#8230; some of whom are unfortunately licensed therapists.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">It is natural to laugh at absurdity.  It would have been difficult to write about the sales booth within the conference room hawking electromagnetic transmission blocking hats without sounding humorous.  But I was outright horrified when a 78 year-old woman, who referred to herself as Julaine, sat before the attendees &#8212; unable to stand for any extended time &#8212; to explain that she had suffered some type of negative diabetic reaction earlier that day, and that her rheumatoid arthritis was causing her no small amount of discomfort.  She attributed both of these conditions to a conspiracy of evil.  Rheumatoid arthritis and Satanic Ritual Abuse, Julaine posited, are “almost partners”.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Clearly, this woman needed real medical attention.  To allow her to delude herself &#8212; or worse, actively feed her the delusion &#8212; that her ill health is a side-effect, and evidence of, satanic conspiracy is beyond irresponsible.  Worse, these delusions have apparently encouraged the aged and infirm Julaine to sever ties with the family members who may have been most willing to help her now&#8230; You see, Julaine’s family, she believes, is a multi-generational satanic cult.  “My sister thinks I’m bi-polar”, she explained.  This, of course, is seen as mere denial.  “She is lost”.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I was perusing the website of another speaker, deJoly LaBrier, when I came across the transcripts of a lecture she had given at a much earlier S.M.A.R.T. gathering.  In it, she told a familiar tale: “[My father] would draw a dot on the wall, and [my siblings and I] would stand at attention with our nose on the dot on the wall, until he told us that we could leave.&#8221;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I clearly remembered hearing the story at the conference I had attended, for it struck me as odd&#8230; Rotten though this nose-to-the-wall experience would be for any child, I couldn’t help but feel such punishments would be quite over-shadowed by the compulsory initiation into sadistic cult rituals and child prostitution that the LaBrier claimed had also taken place&#8230; So much so that being made to stand in a fixed position felt rather unworthy of mention.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">But it wasn’t LaBrier who told this tale at the 2009 conference.  It was Julaine.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Had it occurred to Neil Brick (who is a licensed and practicing “Mental Health Counselor” in Massachusetts), or any other attending therapist, that Julaine may not in fact have been victim to “Moriah, Illuminati&#8230; whatever you want to call it” (as she referred to “Them” in her lecture), but rather an incredibly suggestible and vulnerable old woman who has difficulty distinguishing stories she has heard from her own autobiographical memory?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Apparently not.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">To allow any such questions to encroach on any one of the delusive narratives told would cast doubt on them all&#8230; and they all had their own ludicrous tales defend with nothing more than shallow assertions of recovered memory accuracy.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">For this reason, not even the most impossible of claims were met with so much as a raised eye-brow or embarrassed cough.  Nobody showed a hint of doubt when a speaker going by the name of “Royal”, at all of about forty years of age, stood before us to claim that she was a personal slave to nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  “My experience with Mengele”, Royal explained in a lecture (the gist of which was that Satan uses abortion as a means of traumatic mind-control), “involved much of the trauma-based mind control involving core programming (such as End-Time programming) that is connected to the global take over. He used the Psychic/Spiritual dimensions using, what I have come to call ‘demonic harmonics’, which involves using musical tones and quantum physics to open up portals into the spiritual realms. I also have core programs set up that were created using abortions as a means to develop them and more.”</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Following the publication of the report, Brick went all to pieces, leaving angry comments, penning a “rebuttal”.  Oddly enough though, none of his objections confronted my outrage at the absurdity of the very conspiracy theory that underlies the entire narrative framework of the conference, and of S.M.A.R.T., itself.  Though claiming I misrepresented the entire affair, he failed to explain how.  He failed to answer any questions regarding his own experiences as an “alleged” victim of “Masonic Ritual Abuse and MK-ULTRA”.  He failed to answer any questions directly aimed at elaboration upon his belief in a massive satanic conspiracy.  He failed to confront any questions regarding the content of the conference to instead assert, again and again, supported with lists of journal article citations supporting the view, that recovered memories are real phenomenon.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">If by “attack” he means “directly confront them with their own incredible narratives, question their defense of such narratives when told by others, while asking clarification on where the demarcation between recovered memories and delusions can be found (unless we are to unquestioningly accept all stories of satanic conspiracy, alien abduction, and past-life regression)”, then this fear is well-founded.  But if these people, this “everyone”, within Brick’s “field” agree with his notions of Satanic Ritual Abuse and Mind-Control, and if they feel that this is a position that is evidence-based and rational, then my scrutiny should not be an object of fear.  It should be welcomed, and the answers to any such questions should be forthcoming.  If instead, they choose to distance themselves from Neil Brick only to conceal a position that is not supported by evidence, can not be justified by facts, only so that they may hide their delusions behind the professional veneer afforded to repressed memory theory by way of poor retrospective surveys and bad data&#8230; then they are a craven lot indeed, and would be fully deserving of Neil Brick’s scorn&#8230;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">If only he’d acted any differently himself&#8230;Ironically, this all stemmed from <a title="Report From 2009 S.M.A.R.T. Conference" href="http://www.process.org/discept/2009/08/25/report-from-the-s-m-a-r-t-ritual-abusemind-control-conference-2009/"></div>
<p>Having entered the hotel slightly after the opening speaker of S.M.A.R.T.’s twelfth annual Ritual Abuse, Secretive Organizations, and Mind-Control conference began, I was told by a large woman sitting behind the registration table that I would have to wait until I could be properly registered before entering. I took a seat just outside the open door of the conference room where I could observe the full proceedings within. Brick stood at the podium. As I described him later in my subsequent “defamatory” report, he is a “small man in his 50s with a greasy dark curly comb-over, large thick glasses, and a voice that sounds exacly like Elmer Fudd (without the impediment of pronouncing his Rs as Ws).”</p>
<p>He was delivering the opening remarks. He was wearing a button-up shirt at least two sizes too large for his diminutive frame.  (This physical description is important when you consider his claim to have been a type of super-soldier for Black Ops military.)  Reading directly from his notes in a mechanical word-by-word monotone, without once looking up, he emotionlessly railed against skeptics who have sought to discredit ritual abuse as well as the validity of &#8220;recovered memories&#8221;.<span id="more-750"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is overwhelming scientific evidence that recovered memory exists as a phenomenon&#8221;, he asserted. He began to quote at length from sources that agree with this position.</p>
<p>A belief in the historical accuracy of recovered memories, as I had already discerned from their website, is vital to S.M.A.R.T.&#8217;s belief in a conspiracy of satanic cults and government mind-control. The theory espoused by recovered memory proponents (and well known in popular culture), is that traumatic memories of abuse may be repressed &#8211; relegated to some dark corner of the mind &#8211; where they unfailingly metastasize into some type of chronic negative emotions, compulsions, confusion, even physical ailments. Preserved in high-definition, and unerring detail, these oppressive unconscious memories must be drawn out, retrieved, relived, confronted, and reconciled within the conscious mind, before the victim can lead a happy and productive life.</p>
<p>Almost all of the self-proclaimed victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse have recovered their memories of victimization while undergoing some type of psychotherapy. For the most part, these memories are the only type of “evidence” they attempt to present in support of the claim that such victimization ever occurred.</p>
<p>The process of digging for repressed traumatic memories through hypnosis or other techniques is most often employed in treatment of the diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now re-labeled as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in the American Psychiatric Association&#8217;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Due to their almost total reliance upon recovered memory evidence, purveyors of satanic cult stories are often also defenders of the controversial multiple personality diagnosis, a condition that itself is dismissed by some psychiatrists and psychologists as a &#8220;behavioral artifact&#8230; generated by suggestion in vulnerable people.&#8221; (See below: Concerned Psychiatrists&#8217; and Psychologists&#8217; letter to the APA&#8217;s DSM-V Task Force.)</p>
<p>Critics of Recovered Memory Therapy point out that the act of digging for memories assumed to be repressed can have a subtly coercive effect on clients who &#8211; knowing what they are supposed to be &#8220;remembering&#8221; &#8211; are at least as prone to confabulating false memories as they are to recalling anything with historical accuracy. Given that such critics of recovered memory therapy often point directly to highly improbable claims of satanic cult abuse as evidence of false memories, it was no surprise that Neil Brick breezily dismissed skeptics as conspirators: &#8220;There is [&#8230;] a lot of evidence that those attacking the theory of recovered memory may have ulterior motives. For example, they may have been accused of child abuse crimes or may have been connected to mind control research in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using &#8220;child abuse&#8221; interchangeably with &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221;, Brick attempted to further bolster a position that those who doubt the existence of an international brain-washing coven simply despise tykes: &#8220;The media turned on child abuse survivors in the early and mid 1990′s and began to in essence support those that has [sic] perpetrated crimes against children, believing unfounded stories about so called &#8216;miscarriages of justice.&#8217; Due to the extreme nature of ritual abuse crimes and the psychological need for the public denial of these crimes, it became an easy sell to spin these crimes against children for the public to believe the misstatements about falsely accused perpetrators. After ritual abuse was discredited, then other child abuse crimes could be more easily discredited.&#8221;</p>
<p>There you have it. You’re either with Neil Brick, or you’re with the Satanists. You either believe every outrageous claim of demonic doings, or you’re part of the cover-up. At best, you’re simply in “denial”.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the woman at the registration table, who had also been watching Neil Brick through the open door, began to lightly sob. She grabbed a nearby tissue, dried her eyes, and blew her nose.</p>
<p>I stared uncomfortably down at the program in my hands. I came looking for the reasons, the so-called evidence that compels this continued belief in satanic cult crimes&#8230; of mind control&#8230; to see the self-proclaimed byproducts of the brutal puppet masters said to control the highest reaches of the world governments with an inhuman disdain for life and liberty. Instead &#8211; with scheduled lectures entitled &#8220;Dissociation and Time Management&#8221; and &#8220;The DID RA [Ritual Abuse] Family: An Attachment Perspective on a Forensic Relationship&#8221; &#8211; this conference appeared to be primarily adapted toward defending the DID diagnosis.</p>
<p>According to his biographical synopsis on the program, Neil Brick describes himself as a “survivor of alleged Masonic Ritual Abuse and MK-ULTRA [the CIA&#8217;s covert mind-control and chemical interrogation project of 1950s &#8211; 60s]“. The disclaimer of the word “alleged” in his own biographical description is perplexing&#8230;</p>
<p>I mulled over this as Brick eventually concluded his labored lecture. What did it mean?</p>
<p>Brick came out to the registration table during the break following his presentation gripping a briefcase. He scrutinized me momentarily.</p>
<p>I checked out. Given the nod, my attendance was then officially approved.</p>
<p>I stationed myself anonymously in the second to last occupied row at the far left side of the room.</p>
<p>Never, it occurred to me, have I heard anybody describe oneself as an &#8220;alleged victim of a mugging&#8221;, nor would I expect one to tell me, &#8220;I was allegedly harassed by a drunkard last night&#8221;. Considering this, I wondered if perhaps Neil Brick himself is uncertain as to whether or not he was a victim of the CIA or Masonic abuse. In fact, despite a veneer of confident assurance that the satanic conspiracy is an unquestionable item of fact, the conference was rife with inconsistency and an undercurrent of doubt&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, it was the inconsistent, and wildly incredible, content of the conference that I focused on in my writing. And this was no mere point-and-laugh tactic for the amusement of those who cultivate an air of superiority with smug disbelief toward any outside notion. The conference wasn’t merely absurd, I saw it as harmful and exploitative to the attendees &#8212; many of whom seemed to imagine it as therapeutic &#8212; as well as some of the speakers&#8230; some of whom are unfortunately licensed therapists.</p>
<p>It is natural to laugh at absurdity. It would have been difficult to write about the sales booth within the conference room hawking electromagnetic transmission blocking hats without sounding humorous. But I was outright horrified when a 78 year-old woman, who referred to herself as Julaine, sat before the attendees &#8212; unable to stand for any extended time &#8212; to explain that she had suffered some type of negative diabetic reaction earlier that day, and that her rheumatoid arthritis was causing her no small amount of discomfort. She attributed both of these conditions to a conspiracy of evil. Rheumatoid arthritis and Satanic Ritual Abuse, Julaine posited, are “almost partners”.</p>
<p>Clearly, this woman needed real medical attention. To allow her to delude herself &#8212; or worse, actively feed her the delusion &#8212; that her ill health is a side-effect, and evidence of, satanic conspiracy is beyond irresponsible. Worse, these delusions have apparently encouraged the aged and infirm Julaine to sever ties with the family members who may have been most willing to help her now&#8230; You see, Julaine’s family, she believes, is a multi-generational satanic cult. “My sister thinks I’m bi-polar”, she explained. This, of course, is seen as mere denial. “She is lost”.</p>
<p>That Julaine is highly impressionable seemed apparent at the conference, but it was after the conference that this became quite clear.</p>
<p>I was perusing the website of another speaker, deJoly LaBrier, when I came across the transcripts of a lecture she had given at a much earlier S.M.A.R.T. gathering. In it, she told a familiar tale: “[My father] would draw a dot on the wall, and [my siblings and I] would stand at attention with our nose on the dot on the wall, until he told us that we could leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>I clearly remembered hearing the story at the conference I had attended, for it struck me as odd&#8230; Rotten though this nose-to-the-wall experience would be for any child, I couldn’t help but feel such punishments would be quite over-shadowed by the compulsory initiation into sadistic cult rituals and child prostitution that LaBrier claimed had also taken place&#8230; So much so that being made to stand in a fixed position felt rather unworthy of mention.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t LaBrier who told this tale at the 2009 conference. It was Julaine.</p>
<p>Had it occurred to Neil Brick (who is a licensed and practicing “Mental Health Counselor” in Massachusetts), or any other attending therapist, that Julaine may not in fact have been victim to “Moriah, Illuminati&#8230; whatever you want to call it” (as she referred to “Them” in her lecture), but rather an incredibly suggestible and vulnerable old woman who has difficulty distinguishing stories she has heard from her own autobiographical memory?</p>
<p>Apparently not.</p>
<p>To allow any such questions to encroach on any one of the delusive narratives told would cast doubt on them all&#8230; and they all had their own ludicrous tales to defend with nothing more than shallow assertions of recovered memory accuracy.</p>
<p>For this reason, not even the most impossible of claims were met with so much as a raised eye-brow or embarrassed cough. Nobody showed a hint of doubt when a speaker going by the name of “Royal”, at all of about forty years of age, stood before us to claim that she was a personal slave to nazi doctor Josef Mengele. “My experience with Mengele”, Royal explained in a lecture (the gist of which was that Satan uses abortion as a means of traumatic mind-control), “involved much of the trauma-based mind control involving core programming (such as End-Time programming) that is connected to the global take over. He used the Psychic/Spiritual dimensions using, what I have come to call ‘demonic harmonics’, which involves using musical tones and quantum physics to open up portals into the spiritual realms. I also have core programs set up that were created using abortions as a means to develop them and more.”</p>
<p>Following the publication of the report, Brick went all to pieces, leaving angry comments, penning a “rebuttal”. Oddly enough though, none of his objections confronted my outrage at the absurdity of the very conspiracy theory that underlies the entire narrative framework of the conference, and of S.M.A.R.T., itself. Though claiming I misrepresented the entire affair, he failed to explain how. He failed to answer any questions regarding his own experiences as an “alleged” victim of “Masonic Ritual Abuse and MK-ULTRA”.

<p>A Group of Concerned Psychiatrists and Psychologists</p>

<p>RE: Dissociative Identity Disorder and DSM-V</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Kupfer:</p>
<p>We are writing to you to express concern with respect to the continuation of Dissociative Identity Disorder as an approved diagnosis within the forthcoming DSM-V. We believe that the identification of Multiple Personality Disorder, and later its name change as Dissociative Identity Disorder, has been harmful to the good sense and reputation of psychiatry, not to mention the cause of grave ill-effects to large numbers of patients and their families. In the attached document we maintain that the diagnosis should be removed from DSM-V and we provide the basis for our request. If either the Task Force or Council is unable to agree on removing DID completely from the 5th Edition we suggest that at the very least it should be placed in Appendix B as an experimental criterion set requiring further investigation.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Signatories</p>
<p>(Please see Appendix A)</p>
<p>Attachments</p>
<p>To: DSM-V Task Force &amp;</p>
<p>Work Group on Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum,</p>
<p>Posttraumatic &amp; Dissociative Disorders</p>
<p>Statement on:</p>
<p>The need to remove Dissociative Identity Disorder from DSM-V or place it in Appendix B</p>
<p>The evidence supporting this diagnosis as a distinct mental disorder is modest whereas much suggests it to be a behavioral artifact equivalent in nature to pseudo-epilepsy generated by suggestion in vulnerable people. Its identification as a special, separate diagnostic entity in DSM has harmed the practice of psychiatry and undermined its scientific credibility. Although it is important for us to provide evidence to support these statements, we wish to avoid excessive detail, given that such evidence has been documented widely in the published literature.</p>
<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
<p>The notion of dual personalities was founded upon cases of bipolar illness (1) and was followed by the idea of extra personalities. This expansion first occurred with the hypnotically-induced introduction of a second personality and the deliberate naming of those personalities as if they were separate entities (1).</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence</strong></p>
<p>Taylor and Martin (2) recognized a total of 76 cases occurring between 1816 and 1944—slightly more than one every two years; they thought a similar number might be unreported. In 1954 Thigpen and Cleckley (3) reported their case, which was published as “The Three Faces of Eve” in 1957. After a film was made of this case, the numbers of reported cases increased steadily; there was a further dramatic leap after the film of “Sybil”. By 1990 thousands of cases were being diagnosed; some authors identified more cases in their personal practices than had been described in the literature over an entire century.</p>
<p><strong>Twentieth Century Suggestion</strong></p>
<p>As is well known, Sybil, a patient of Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, was fully aware that her therapist wanted her to create extra personalities (4). In 1973, Dr. Wilbur gave tape recordings of Sybil’s interviews to Schreiber [the journalist who reported Sybil as a case of multiple personality disorder (5)]. Schreiber made the recordings available to Ronald Rieber, a professor of psychology, who amassed evidence showing that at least some of the personalities were artifacts overtly created in treatment (6).</p>
<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>
<p>Dissociative Identity Disorder is often alleged to result from repressing an experience of childhood sexual abuse. This claim has not received adequate scientific validation. For example, Piper and Merskey (7) reviewed all the studies that claimed to corroborate DID patients’ abuse recollections. These authors concluded that “no evidence supports the claim that DID patients as a group have actually experienced the traumas asserted by the disorder’s proponents” (7).</p>
<p>Proponents of the DID diagnosis assert that horrific, repeated childhood physical and sexual abuse is the primary cause of DID. Victims supposedly develop their multiple personalities as repositories for traumatic memories that the “host” personality is unable to tolerate consciously. The DID diagnosis thus relies on the concept of traumatic Dissociative Amnesia (DA or “repression”): the notion that the mind protects itself by banishing terrifying memories from awareness, rendering them inaccessible until the person feels psychologically safe to recall them, often years later. There is no convincing evidence that victims can become incapable of recalling genuinely traumatic experiences, as the trauma theory of DID requires (8). Indeed, an extensive survey of the historical literature, including both fictional and non-fictional written works in multiple languages, found no written example of “dissociative amnesia” prior to 1786 (9). Thus the notion of “repressing” a memory itself, like DID, appears to represent a recent culture-bound phenomenon, rather than a naturally occurring human psychological process.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive analysis of studies of people with documented trauma histories, not a single mention of spontaneous amnesia for the traumatic event was found—unless the forgetting was attributable to either organic amnesia or childhood amnesia (10). Finally, an examination of Freud’s original work gives reason to think that the evidence from psychoanalysis for repression is also very unsatisfactory (11, 12).</p>
<p><strong>Harmful Effects</strong></p>
<p>Due to the assumption that trauma is a primary etiological factor, the DID diagnosis has resulted in wrongful accusations of sexual abuse on the basis of recovered memories, not only in North America but throughout the developed world (references). DID has caused mockery of psychiatry, and, for patients, has led to misdiagnosis (13), mismanagement (14) and inadequate treatment of depression (15).</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Consensus</strong></p>
<p>Canadian and American psychiatrists show little consensus regarding the diagnostic status and scientific validity of DID. In surveys of board-certified psychiatrists in the United States (16) and Canada (17) fewer than one-third of Canadian psychiatrists and 35% of American psychiatrists replied that DA &amp; DID should be included without reservations in the DSM-IV; fewer than 1 in 7 Canadian psychiatrists and only 21-23% of American psychiatrists replied that there was “strong evidence of validity” for these disorders. French- and English-speaking Canadians had similar opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>There are overwhelming reasons to question the validity of Dissociative Identity Disorder. We respectfully urge you as members of the Work Group and the Task Force to drop the category of dissociative disorders from the upcoming DSM-V: it is harmful to patients and their families, scientifically unjustified, and undermining the credibility of psychiatry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the first report of my experiences with individuals who feel that they have had personal contact with extraterrestrials.  More are forthcoming.  Where appropriate, names have been changed&#8230;</em></p>
<div id="attachment_739" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-739" class="size-medium wp-image-739" title="not actually an alien" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/P22402081-225x300.jpg" alt="out-sized forehead, black almond-shaped eyes" width="180" height="240" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/P22402081-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/P22402081.JPG 432w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /><p id="caption-attachment-739" class="wp-caption-text">out-sized forehead, black almond-shaped eyes</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Laughlin, Nevada is the kind of place where vegetarianism is deviant.  Even the lentil soup comes served with large chunks of sausage in it&#8230; Thick, greasy, lips-and-asshole chorizo sausage.  Even when picked out, it befouls the rest of the soup with its putrid flavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have to send it back.  &#8220;This has sausage in it&#8221;, I tell the waitress.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Yes&#8221;, the waitress says, nonplussed, &#8220;you ordered the lentil soup&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The atmosphere has abruptly changed.  My effeminate coastal dietary peculiarities have made my presence suddenly unwelcome.  I feel a wave of panic fill the room.  At surrounding tables, the bloated men in cowboy hats are, I imagine, wishing that they were thirty years younger, so that they might rise up to knock some sense into my goddamn skull.  To the people of Laughlin, it appears, there is nothing particularly bizarre about a group of UFO seekers holding a conference in their town, but a man who doesn&#8217;t eat meat is truly a freakish thought.  Christ, it&#8217;s already noon and I don&#8217;t even have a beer in my hand.  To the generally upper middle-aged, beer-bellied, cigarette-sallowed gamblers of this obscure poor-man&#8217;s alternative to Reno, I am an interloper.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I feel more at ease among the ET enthusiasts.  My initial impression is that they display nothing of the unwelcoming, bitter homogeneity of the Ritual Abuse crowd.  Among them are Science Fiction fans and writers, Fortean chroniclers of anomalous events, students of the paranormal, and the mere curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The diversity is an unexpected relief.  The two-hour shuttle ride from the Vegas airport to Laughlin gave grim indications that the conference would be strictly populated by elderly New Agers.</span><span id="more-730"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Earlier that day, I was among the first to be shuffled aboard the small bus just outside the baggage claim.  Freshly acquainted geriatric galactic citizens bemoaned the horrifying quality of in-flight meals between refined excoriations against the blind ignorance of the mainstream masses who, despite overwhelming evidence, remain skeptical to the fact that Earth is being regularly visited by extraterrestrial intelligences.  They were all warming up for the conference, taking full advantage of this opportunity to preach to a captive choir.  Self proclaimed &#8220;intuitives&#8221;, aura readers, psychics, and UFOlogists all began climbing aboard to contribute to an increasing din of metaphysical philosophies, conspiracy theories, and Aquarian Age wisdom.  Full groups spoke to each other simultaneously, without a single member listening.  The driver announced that we would be leaving in five minutes, precisely on the hour, no exceptions, at which a strained looking old fellow took immediate leave.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right back,&#8221; he assured the driver.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ten minutes after the hour, the impatient passengers abandoned their peaceful transcendent pretensions and began to suggest with undisguised agitation that we should move on without our missing comrade.  A man volunteered to look for him.  He came back and reported something in confidence to the driver who then announced, &#8220;Two more minutes!&#8221; and started the engine.  Our fact-finder sat back down across from me.  &#8220;He&#8217;s taking a shit&#8221;, he muttered ruefully to the passenger next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Soon enough our man returned, sullen and shamed, head low.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We&#8217;re away even before he&#8217;s seated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The responsible chronicler in me wanted that I should I mingle with the other passengers, at least listen to what they were talking about, despite a fatigue-induced disinterest.  Somebody was talking about media misinformation, another about how the UFO deniers are &#8220;asleep&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Good enough.  I put on my headphones and listened to music, partially falling asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, my interest is in those who claim to have been in personal contact with extraterrestrial beings.  That most reports of such contact are based upon recovered memories is a well-known fact.  How are these recovered memories similar or different to those reporting satanic cult activity?  Proponents of recovered memories of abuse, uncomfortable with the association to ET abduction, are quick to dismiss the parallel as a cheap-shot, a low-brow attempt at discrediting all recovered memories.  But, without a method by which one may reliably distinguish legitimate recovered memories from fabrications or confabulations, the abductees present a unique challenge.  If one can cultivate entire false memory scenarios regarding sometimes traumatic contact with alien beings, why could one not also construct such false memories about any traumatic experience?  And what makes a more plausible recovered memory any less likely to be a false construction than an implausible one?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was, I had understood, the consistency of the abduction tales that counter-balanced their implausibility with credibility.  After all, how could it be that so many people, personally and geographically unrelated, would have such similar narratives of extraterrestrial encounters if these were but personal delusions?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Despite the fact that abduction stories are so prevalent in popular culture as to render this argument ludicrous, the question has proven undeniably compelling not only to fringe spiritual seekers, but to a few respected academics and journalists as well.  Most notably, professor John Mack of Harvard Medical School undertook an enormous study of over 200 abductees from 6 continents in the course of over 10 years, till his death in 2004 when he was struck by a drunken driver while crossing a London street.  Mack, encouraged by his long-time friend, author Thomas Kuhn, rejected what he felt to be an inhibiting materialist dualism that is &#8220;held in place by the structures, categories, and polarities of language, such as real/unreal, exists/does not exist, objective/subjective, intrapsychic/external world, and happened/did not happen.&#8221; (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abduction-Encounters-John-E-Mack/dp/1416575804/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287454302&amp;sr=8-9"><span style="color: #800080;">Mack, 1994</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mack set out to &#8220;collect raw information, putting aside whether or not what I was learning fit any particular world view.&#8221; (Mack, 1994)  Inevitably, though, Mack strained to fit his data into a world view, albeit a world view that was unconstrained by parsimony and the standard burden of scientific proof.  To Dr. Mack, abduction experiences were real &#8220;in some way&#8221;, suggesting that they could be attributed to interdimensional travel rather than intragalactic.  And while Mack did consider the possibility that the abduction experience was the product of an altered state, his altered state abduction wasn&#8217;t a purely internal, subjective experience, rather it was an altered state of higher consciousness that elicited communication with higher beings. (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passport-Cosmos-Human-Transformation-Encounters/dp/1601641613/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1287454448&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="color: #800080;">Mack, 1999</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In his book Passport To The Cosmos, Mack explains, &#8220;It is not just the experiencers&#8217; conviction that what they have undergone is in some way real that has made me take them seriously.  The richly detailed narratives they provide, the appropriate surprise, the convincing incredulity, and above all the genuine distress or other feelings they report, together with the observable emotion and intense bodily reactions they exhibit when their experiences are recalled &#8211; all these elements combined can give any witness the sense that something powerful has happened to these individuals, however impossible this may seem from the standpoint of our traditional worldview.&#8221; (Mack, 1999)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Mack&#8217;s claims of narrative consistency notwithstanding, the abduction accounts I end up hearing at the 2010 UFO Congress convention in Laughlin, Nevada &#8211; from those who claimed to have experienced them &#8211; are surprisingly inconsistent even given the near universal knowledge of how &#8220;actual&#8221; abductions are supposed to be carried out.  At the very least, I had felt, everybody agreed upon who was responsible: little grey humanoids &#8211; &#8220;Greys&#8221;, they&#8217;ve been cleverly dubbed &#8211; with outsized hairless heads, large black almond-shaped eyes, and frail bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Turns out there is a whole carnival of different species beaming people into different types of craft, and for different purposes &#8211; some benevolent, some&#8230; not so much.  The Contactees happily share apparently well-worn, scripted descriptions of the multitudes of distorted other-world craniums and non-human eyes they&#8217;ve observed.  There are mammalians, crustaceans, and ETs entirely human in appearance.  The galactic community, it seems, is as diverse as human imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Greys? &#8230;Oh, yes, them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Well, they are out there, up to their antics still, but they seem to have fallen out of fashion of late.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Given this variety of interplanetary taxonomic categories and their broad spectrum of individual motivations for the covert Earth capers they&#8217;re said to be engaged in, these are not &#8220;abductee&#8221; sessions that I am attending as an optional evening supplement to the larger conference&#8230;  As hypnotherapist (and session organizer) Mary Rodwell explains, the word &#8220;abductee&#8221; carries with it certain obvious negative connotations that do not do justice to many of the &#8220;life-enhancing&#8221; extraterrestrial encounters that many of her clients have reported.  Rodwell prefers the more neutral word &#8220;experiencer&#8221;.  Thus, if we could refer to each other as experiencers rather than abductees, we&#8217;d all be a bit happier, yes?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There is dissent.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair,&#8221; one harried man objects.  His experience has very much been one of being taken against his will, and he seems as skeptical of reports of positive alien encounters as most people are of tales of alien contact in general.  His, presumably, was one of those close-encounters of the orifice-stretching kind, and he reserves the right &#8211; by God &#8211; to refer to himself as an abductee.  There is agreement from a few others in the group of about 30 who sat in a tight circle of chairs within the small windowless hotel meeting room.  The &#8220;Experiencer&#8221; label, they feel, is a whitewash.  They are Abductees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Very well then.  Rodwell is flexible, conveying herself with a saintly air of tolerance.  She wants the evening Experiencer Sessions to &#8220;honor&#8221; all varieties of ET contact.  If there are those who wish to refer to themselves as &#8220;abductees&#8221;, all well and good.  So long as everybody is sensitive to the fact that &#8220;abductee&#8221; is an unacceptable blanket label to be applied to all in the room.  The abductees begrudgingly agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mary Rodwell holds the title of &#8220;Principal&#8221; at an organization called </span><a href="http://www.acern.com.au/"><span style="color: #800080;">ACERN</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> (Australian Close Encounters Resource Network), with the stated goal of offering &#8220;professional counselling support, hypnotherapy and information to individuals and their families who have ‘anomalous’ paranormal experiences, particularly specializing in Abduction/contact experiences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“If you don’t want to share and just want to listen, that’s fine”, Rodwell assures us all, much to my relief.  My unease at the prospect of around-the-circle individual introductions and biographical synopses had been growing since realizing that I am, quite possibly, the only person in the room with no memories of contact with ETs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“The other thing I’d like you to respect is everyone has their own understanding of their experiences,&#8221; Rodwell explains.  &#8220;No matter how one chooses to understand it doesn’t mean you have to subscribe to that, it just means that that’s where they are with their experiences, that’s how they choose to understand it, though it may not resonate for you.  It may not fit for you at all.  But that’s okay, because we have the right to interpret our experiences whatever way feels right to us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A middle-aged Latin man seated to my immediate left is eager to tell of his experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I’m not really good at public speaking, in fact I have a phobia about speaking in groups.  But I’m here tonight because I want to be around people who have had experiences.  I’ve been an experiencer for approximately 25 years.  It started when I was living in the Central Valley.  I was a professional person.  I was a parole agent.  And when I started experiencing contact, I could never talk to anybody because I was a professional man and I couldn’t approach my supervisor and say, hey, I’m speaking to little grey guys.  So I just pretty much kept it to myself.  So my main reason for being here is just hearing other people’s stories and not feeling so awkward about what my own personal experiences have been.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He finishes there, apparently having gotten off his chest what he wanted to express, just enjoying &#8211; it seems &#8211; being in an environment wherein he can declare himself an &#8220;experiencer&#8221; without feeling that he&#8217;ll have made himself outcast by doing so.  And this is how most of the testimonials carry on throughout this first night.  Experiencers within the circle talk about the various ways in which they present themselves to outsiders, some claiming to heavily advertise their relationship with extraterrestrials, others describing the daily discomfort of keeping this part of their lives constantly concealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One woman chimes in: &#8220;I just want to say, chances are that each one of us &#8212; in fact chances are really good &#8212; I’ve probably already lived half my life.  I’m in my fifties.  And I’m at a point in my life where it’s really important to me to be who I am.  And I think that the extraterrestrial, interdimensional &#8212; whatever type of contact it is &#8212; that it is a significant part of my life&#8230; It has been for a long time.  Um&#8230;  I have had stages of being made fun of, of being talked about behind my back, being called crazy.  I used to really, really care about that.  And it used to really hurt my feelings&#8230; It was more important to me how other people thought of me than how I actually felt about me &#8212; you know, as far as being true to myself.  So&#8230; I’m at a stage in my life where when I meet people &#8212; and let’s say they’re neighbors &#8212;  there are people, like, up in the mountains.  We have a place up in the country, about 35 acres around a bunch of country people.  When I meet people, they come into my life, I let it be known right away.  You know, this is part of my life.  They have a choice whether they want to associate with me or not associate with me&#8230; there are no secrets&#8230; but on the other side of that, you know, at that point in time, they can say or think whatever they want to say or think  about me.  I don’t care.  It’s not important to me any more.  I figure people that are like me will resonate toward me, and those that aren’t will hopefully stay away.  And also along with that: if I’m like a crazy person that everybody’s talking about, possibly they’ll talk to somebody who is out there who is having life experiences, who doesn’t feel like they can talk to anybody&#8230; and they’ll know they can talk to me&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I find myself sympathizing with the experiencers.  Aside from being far friendlier than the <a href="http://www.process.org/discept/2009/08/25/report-from-the-s-m-a-r-t-ritual-abusemind-control-conference-2009/"><span style="color: #800080;">morose and self-entitled Ritual Abuse fantasists</span></a>, they also aren&#8217;t directly victimizing individuals by labeling their unfortunate families as the revealed perpetrators of repressed episodes of abuse.  Further, it&#8217;s annoying to think of religious literalists &#8211; believers in the Son of God&#8217;s imminent return to Earth to attend Good and Evil&#8217;s promosed apocalyptic show-down &#8211; having the audacity to laugh at these no-less-probable scenarios constructed by the experiencers.  This is not to say that I feel abductees should be able to declare the absolute truth of their ET contact episodes without critical objection.  Quite the contrary.  Truth matters, and individual liberties <em>are</em> at stake.  This sub-set of recovered memory advocates give license to those of the witch-hunting kind.  It&#8217;s all well and good to play philosophical games with questions like &#8220;Whose Truth?&#8221; until individual liberties and personal well-beings are threatened, at which point we must defer to the best method for knowing &#8220;truth&#8221; we&#8217;ve yet devised: scientific &#8220;materialism&#8221;&#8230; unromantic and inhibiting as it might seem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The most perplexing comments, to my mind, this first night&#8217;s experiencer session, come from a couple of fellows who have no conscious memory of abduction, but feel that their lives have been a more-or-less regular stream of anomalous events for which alien intervention seems the most rational explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Karl, a man in his late-thirties from Wyoming, tells of synchronicities, &#8220;psychic events&#8221;, and vague &#8220;anomalies&#8221; that have led him to suspect that extraterrestrials are watching him.  One night, not long ago, he felt an odd compulsion to take a tent out into the woods.  Before sleeping, he tells us, he asked for some sign, some acknowledgment, confirmation from these outer world beings that they are watching.  He slept the whole night through without incident.  But, upon returning home, he checked his email to find the confirmation that he had asked for: a girl he had gone to school with, who he hadn&#8217;t thought about in years, but who had come to mind in short proximity preceding his compelled camp-out, had sent him a Facebook friend request.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was waiting for more.  I was waiting for Karl&#8217;s story to bring us inside of a space-craft, into a vivisection lab&#8230;  Something.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But that was it.  A none-too-incredible synchronicity that, even if one felt certain couldn&#8217;t be &#8220;mere coincidence&#8221;, could have fit any number of supernatural narratives&#8230;  This was taken as a clear signal of extraterrestrial activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A short, over-weight man named Clem tells a tale equally unremarkable.  One night, he was in his bathroom when the light-bulb started humming and vibrating.  &#8220;I reached up to touch it&#8221;, Clem tells us, &#8220;Bwoosh!&#8221;, he spreads his hands and extends his arms, indicating an explosion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As with Karl, Clem&#8217;s story ends before I can figure out its meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After the session, I&#8217;m fortunate in that Clem approaches me and immediately begins to elaborate:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“If I was to reach up, you know, and touch something in the light I’m certain that nothing would have happened, but I didn’t want to take the chance.”  He&#8217;s still marveling over the event, but I still have no idea what this has to do with ETs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“So did you do hypnosis?”  I ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“No!  No no.  No.  This was &#8212; I was in the bathroom.  I’m putting on a t-shirt.  And you know, you got those [?] deals on the lights.  I got two lights, and I just happen to touch it.  And it just went &#8212; it just started to vibrate, and &#8212; you ever see Star Wars?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Where the Death Star exploded?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“That’s what this did.  And the lamp, the light itself &#8211; nothing happened to it.  It burned out like a year later&#8230; but this was just&#8230; I’d never seen anything like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Something different entirely entirely, huh?”  I ask, not certain what else to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“It was &#8211; Yeah!  That was something different entirely!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Did you ever do a regression like she [Rodwell] does?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It turns out, Clem has been regressed, but he seems reticent to speak of memories of direct ET contact.  He continues to tell me about his bizarre electrical problems.  &#8220;That comes and goes&#8221;, he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“And like several years ago, I had a Lincoln&#8230;&#8221;  Clem lowers his voice and leans in closer to me, as though he is about to confide to me something so frightening and abnormal that he doesn&#8217;t want to distress any innocent passers-by who might overhear.  &#8220;I’m driving to work one day, and I keep losing power.  And I say, what the Hell’s going on?  So, I park it, and I went into work.  And I go to my mechanic the next day, and I sez, so what the Hell happened?  And he sez, you know, in the hundreds and hundreds of engines I’ve worked on, I’ve never seen anything like this.  I was like out of a cheap b-movie&#8230;  [The mechanic] pops the hood &#8211;”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Clem pauses and looks me in the eye dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yeah?” I urge him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Takes a wrench and holds it up towards the engine &#8211;”  Clem raises his fist to illustrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Uh huh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“And it goes *<em>chunk</em>*&#8221;, Clem opens his fist, his gaze following an imaginary wrench that slams into the engine. &#8220;&#8230;It was magnetized!  And he had to reverse the poles of the engine.  Change the battery.  Change the alternator.  Cost me several hundred dollars.  And there was just no rhyme or reason for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;m at a loss.  “Right&#8230;” I say, lamely.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I’ve had experiences, and that kind of thing just drives me nuts.  There’s no sense to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I press Clem to tell me what exactly makes him feel certain that ETs were involved, and of what direct experiences he feels he&#8217;s had with unearthly beings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">He has had contact with ETs, but contact of the psychic kind.  They come to him as voices in his head.  They come into his house at night.  He hears them crawling around&#8230; under the stairs, in the attic.  At this point, my oscillating opinion of the hypnotherapists who perpetuate beliefs in ET encounters is decidedly negative.  Clem, I feel, may need real help.  He begins to describe how difficult it is to talk to some of his friends and family about these kinds of things.  It is comforting to hear, at least, that he does have friends and family to talk to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t be angry at them for finding these things hard to understand,&#8221; I tell him.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to keep things from them, but you also want to hear them out and respect their perspective.  It&#8217;s always good to hear another opinion, regardless of what they make of yours&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Clem agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We shake hands and part ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On my way back to my hotel room, I spot Karl.  He&#8217;s telling another conference-goer who wasn&#8217;t at the session about his remarkable sychronicities.  I can already see a shift in his demeanor.  While he came to the session uncertain that the &#8220;anomalies&#8221; he had experienced were indicative of ET contact, he&#8217;s growing more and more convinced by the moment&#8230;</span></p>

</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> A.  True, except for one little qualifier.  Obviously, physically impossible memories.  Setting that aside, no. </span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> Q.  Something like having a memory of being born would be an example of a physically impossible memory?</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> A.  Right.</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> Q.  And, as you have stated, there are no valid and reliable scientific studies indicating or demonstrating that human beings are capable of repressing a long stream of trauma or dissociating or blocking out through traumatic amnesia, a long stream of events, then accurately recovering those memories years later?  There is no reliable demonstration of that particular phenomenon?</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"> A.  There&#8217;s a couple of studies in the literature, but not sufficient to prove it.  There&#8217;s some data.&#8221;</span></em></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;On or about April 30, 1992, [Dr. Colin] Ross told Ms. Tyo that she would have to leave Charter [hospital] in three weeks, but Ross acknowledged that at that point she might still be suicidal and might still want to mutilate herself.  Subsequent to that conversation, Ms. Tyo went through a period she describes as deep denial.  She denied she was MPD [Multiple Personality Disorder] or had participated in SRA [Satanic Ritual Abuse].  Ross and [Mary E.] Grundman, however, forced her out of her denial by assuring her that their diagnosis was, in fact, correct and the &#8220;memories&#8221; she&#8217;d recovered were true.&#8221;</span></em></div>

Ross, MD, et al&#8230;</span></a></span></em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-682" title="drrossb" alt="Dr. Colin Ross, demonstrating his supernatural eye beams" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/drrossb1.jpg" width="216" height="186" /></p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to one expert witness, it was the worst case of medical malpractice he had ever seen.  The patient, Ms. Roma E. Hart, had been grossly over-medicated into a prolonged state of deranged confusion, during which time the offending psychiatrist, Dr. Colin A. Ross, had instilled her with exotic and perverse delusions:  To wit, the rather implausible belief that her family was involved in an occult crime-ring dedicated to a supernatural evil, and that Hart herself had been forcibly impregnated by extraterrestrials, birthing a hybrid infant (presumably in the course of a routine alien abduction).  The magnitude of Ms. Hart&#8217;s mistreatment during her submission to psychiatric &#8220;care&#8221; brought her to the precipice of death on several occasions.</span><span id="more-675"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">During her treatment Ms. Hart gave custody of her 10 year old daughter over to Child &amp; Family Services so as to preserve the girl from clutches of her Satanic cult family. Thus Ms. Hart lost her entire family in one egregiously misguided moment; her parents unable to forgive her for the accusations of sexual Satanic Ritual Abuse, her daughter heart-broken by abandonment.</span></p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">As you will read in the interview with Ms. Hart below, these are but a few of the annoyances she suffered as result of Ross&#8217;s &#8220;therapy&#8221;.This bizarre malpractice by the hand of Dr. Colin Ross was designed to treat his unfortunate patient of the condition of Multiple Personality Disorder [MPD], a condition Ms. Hart now feels she never had, and many doctors argue doesn&#8217;t exist.  It is a condition that Dr. Ross himself has largely helped define and set the diagnostic and treatment protocols of.  The theory of MPD, unsupported by science, is that an individual undergoing trauma &#8220;dissociates&#8221;, recompartmentalizing the hurtful memories into separate &#8220;personalities&#8221;, personalities that are unaware of one another.</span><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Colin Ross&#8217;s delusions are hardly concealed.  He is a known conspiracy theorist who helped construct the </span><a id="d6.f" title="Article from the Satanic Panic: The Satan Factor" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/satan-factor"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Satanic cult hysteria</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> of the eighties to mid-nineties.  He has written and lectured regarding nefarious mind-control projects within the CIA, and even &#8211; in an interesting case of possible projection &#8211; speculation regarding the &#8220;iatrogenic [clinically produced] creation of Multiple Personality Disorder&#8221; by CIA psychiatrists.  Following Dr. Ross&#8217;s own vernacular, it might be appropriate to suggest that Ross has &#8220;dissociated&#8221; his own crimes of medical mistreatment, projecting them upon a &#8220;personality&#8221; he refers to as &#8220;CIA&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But Ross can not be dismissed as a marginal fool.  He is a well-respected and dangerous fool.  Indeed, Dr. Colin Ross is an &#8220;internationally renowned clinician, researcher, author and lecturer in the field of dissociation and trauma-related disorders&#8221;.  He is founder and President of the </span><a id="alis" title="About the Colin A. Ross Institute" href="http://www.rossinst.com/about_ross_institute.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Colin A. Ross Institute</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> for Psychological Trauma, which &#8220;specializes in the management of psychiatric treatment programs and is currently contracted to provide management and treatment services to Timberlawn Mental Health System, in Dallas, Texas, Forest View Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Del Amo Hospital, in Torrance, California.&#8221;  Ross is &#8220;the author of over 130 professional papers and past President of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation&#8221;, and acts as expert consultant for the Showtime television series </span><a id="pz5_" title="United States of Tara official site" href="http://www.sho.com/site/tara/home.do"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The United States of Tara</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  Dr. Ross has acted as therapist for celebrity Rosanne Barr (who now also believes she recovered memories of childhood abuse), and Cameron West, author of the New York Times bestselling </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">First Person Plural: My Life as a Multiple</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Like all conspiracy theorists, Ross seems to feel he has an understanding of the true cause of all Evil.  Likewise, MPD feeds Ross&#8217;s paranoid fiction as, not only a by-product of a sinister CIA plot, but as a medical condition that serves to explain and negate all others.  Roma Hart gives an example of this over-valuation of the MPD diagnosis by Ross in a personal email to the author:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">[&#8230;]I was regularly in seclusion [whilst an in-patient of Colin Ross], a lovely concrete walled and floored hole where I was locked in for days at a time.  Sometimes [I would be] thrown in, and I&#8217;d have the huge bruises to show for it.  [The seclusion room] was often used for &#8220;behaviour modification&#8221;, I suppose.  You see, when I had seizures from the drugs [Ross had over-medicated],  Ross told the nurses that I was just switching personalities to one called &#8220;Blue&#8221; that had seizures, so they should throw me in seclusion whenever that happened. One evening when [the seizures were] really bad, Ross had the nurses take me down to the ward below and strip me before they dropped me onto the floor.  That [particular] seclusion room had a bad fluorescent light that flickered really badly.  I laid there until the next day when they put me in a wheelchair to take me back up to my other seclusion room.  Those nurses, as I told you before, followed Ross around like panting puppies and did anything he said. I remember when I had my blood pressure taken my nurse asked me if I knew why my blood pressure was so unstable. I was going to answer &#8220;the drugs?&#8221;, but before I could say anything she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s because each of your personalities has its own blood pressure.&#8221; And, of course, [there was] the time that I was nearly killed from an overdose on the ward and I barely made it to the nurse&#8217;s station, gasping for breath, (respiratory arrest) [trying to] get their attention. The nurses became angry at me and demanded that I go back to my room. I fell to the floor and crawled back to my room still struggling with every ounce of my strength for every breath.  This was extrememly frightening and I was so close to dying. I made it to my bed and the nurse took my blood pressure. She wrote it on my bed sheet as a matter of fact: 190/180. The following day after I regained consciousness another nurse came in and took my blood pressure: 60/50.  Well, she remarked, you MPD patients are fascinating. You see, Doug, Ross had told the staff that night that I had &#8220;pulled myself in&#8221; and that it was an &#8220;MPD coma&#8221;, not a real coma.</span></em></p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the face of it, </span><a id="n6sp" title="News article: false memories, Roma Hart" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/roma-news2"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Roma Hart&#8217;s accusations</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> appear absurd.  For this reason, the hyperlinks embedded in this article, showing corroborative sworn testimony and affidavits, are important.  Thus, Ms. Hart&#8217;s claim that Dr. Ross actually encouraged her toward suicide seems quite plausible when taken together with the </span><a id="k1:g" title="suicide deaths" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/suicide-deaths"><span style="color: #000000;">sworn <span style="color: #ff0000;">affidavit of Winnipeg resident George Bergen</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who testifies that Ross&#8217;s therapy drove his sister-in-law and at least four others </span><a id="p4li" title="Bergen's account of his sister-in-law's death" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/bonnie-s-sister-1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to suicide</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, and the statement of Martha Ann Tyo (who also sued Ross for malpractice) indicating an eerily blase attitude, on Ross&#8217;s part, toward the possibility of his client&#8217;s suicide (see quote from Tyo v. Ross above).  The fact that Martha Ann Tyo, a patient in Texas (Hart was treated in Manitoba), tells also of being implanted with a conviction of Satanic Ritual Abuse and alien abduction does much to affirm that these beliefs were a product of Ross&#8217;s mind rather than those of Tyo or Hart. So, though the documents cataloging Dr. Ross&#8217;s criminal incompetence are linked throughout, I shall &#8211; in the spirit of Ross&#8217;s own book, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Bluebird</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">, which seeks full-disclosure of CIA malpractice &#8211; list an index of some of the more important ones here:</span></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Before I started seeing him, I was working constantly.  I was a single mom, I had two jobs, I was going to University full-time, and I had hurt my foot really, really badly.  So I got unemployment insurance, which only lasted a few weeks.  One of my friends said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Hey, you know what?  you can get it extended if you apply for stress</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  I thought, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">cool, why don&#8217;t I do that?  Extra money, get my unemployment extended. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">So I was at University, went the the University Student Psych Centre, figured I could get them to fill out the form for unemployment insurance.  I saw one of the master&#8217;s students there, who was a student of Colin Ross&#8217;s.  She said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">what do you do when you get under stress? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">I said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Well, I just switch to autopilot and just keep on going &#8211; I&#8217;m a single mom, after all. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">And she goes, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Autopilot??  Do you have a name for this &#8220;autopilot&#8221;? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">Her eyes went so big, and she said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">My professor Colin Ross is an expert in </span><a id="wge-" title="Dr. Paul McHugh on Multiple Personality Disorder" href="http://www.psycom.net/mchugh.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Multiple Personality Disorder</span></a></em><span style="color: #000000;">[MPD]</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> and I would just love to work with him.  I&#8217;ll bring you to him and he will fill out the form for you. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">So she put me in the car, drove me down to see Colin Ross, and it was just about 15 minutes before he shook my hand and welcomed me to MPD therapy.  Then I handed him the unemployment insurance form and said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">fill this out for me please. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">And that was it.  I was doomed since.  That was it.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And how in that 15 minutes did he determine that you had MPD?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He had talked to that student councilor at the University of Manitoba &#8211; his student.  She had told him that I said that I switch to autopilot when I&#8217;m under stress.  He determined that she was absolutely correct, that [autopilot] was another personality.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Aha&#8230;</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">But you and I know that [&#8220;running on autopilot&#8221; is] just something people have been saying for years.  It just means you just keep on going because you have to.  You just </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">do</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> without even thinking about it.  I had no idea that anybody would ever interpret that as another personality.  But I thought to myself, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Well, what the heck &#8211; he&#8217;s going to fill out the form &#8211; what possible harm could come? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">I had no idea my life would be ruined after that.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">To kind of work backward so people have an idea right from the get-go what we&#8217;re dealing with:  What are the permanent side-effects you deal with now from having been a victim &#8211; or patient &#8211; of Dr. Ross?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the the biggest problems I have is a permanent record in my medical file that lists me as &#8216;Multiple Personality Disorder&#8217;.  That comes to my face any time I go for any test, any time I have to go to the hospital for X-rays&#8230; you name it.  It&#8217;s right there.  I&#8217;m never taken seriously for anything at all.  It&#8217;s on a permanent record for Child &amp; Family Services because Colin Ross decided that my child was interfering with my therapy, so she was put into foster care.  She was put into foster care and hidden from me and from my whole family from the time she was 10 years old to the time she was 18 years old.  She has completely lost her family.  I lost the most darling child.  I was a single mother.  She and I were so close.  It was like we breathed at the same time.  I lost </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">my </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">whole family.  My parents were teachers.  Because when you&#8217;re diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, Colin Ross believes that 100% of the time, you have been sexually molested by your parents.  He told that to Child &amp; Family Services.  My parents had to take early retirement from their teaching jobs.  My family hates me.  My parents were almost thrown in jail&#8230; And then, of course, there&#8217;s always [the fact that] I had to drop out of University.  My career was ended.  I lost my home.  I lost my friends.  I lost every cent I had&#8230; Then, of course, there&#8217;s the drug experiments that he did.  He did massive and illegal drug experiments on me in the hospital.  And I nearly died several times.  I was in comas, I was in wheelchairs.  I got down to like 55 pounds at 5 foot 5.  I was so, so sick.</span></div>

</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Which Drugs?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main one was Halcion, although he combined a whole bunch on top of each other just very recklessly. </span><a id="mif9" title="Colin Ross: Testimony regarding &quot;ultra-high doses&quot;" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/ross-testimony"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No regard for human safety whatsoever</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  But Halcion: He had me up to 52 milligrams per day<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/#footnote_0_675" id="identifier_0_675" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="&ldquo;The recommended dose for most adults is 0.25 milligrams (mg). In some patients, a lower dose may be prescribed and the maximum daily dose should not exceed 0.5 mg.&rdquo; &ndash; From the Physician&rsquo;s Desk Reference [PDR] online (http://www.pdrhealth.com/drugs/rx/rx-mono.aspx?contentFileName=Hal1192.html&amp;contentName=Halcion&amp;contentId=265">1</a></sup></span></span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Four hundred times the maximum dosage. </span></em><a id="l:mw" title="Cross-Examination: 51 milligrams" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/51mg"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He explains that</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8211; he justifies that &#8211; in one of the court transcripts I sent you &#8211; it&#8217;s really quite appalling &#8211; he justifies that amount by saying that I was a drug-user.  He has told the hospital &#8211; Saint Boniface Hospital, where he treated me &#8211; that I was a heroin addict.  And of course, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">that </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">is why he had to use so many massive amounts of drugs.  Now, I most certainly wasn&#8217;t [a drug-user].  Just a few weeks before I saw him, I got up at six o&#8217;clock in the morning and I spent all morning, until 12:30 at the University, because I was a full-time student.  Then I worked all afternoon until 6 o&#8217;clock at a daycare.  Then I went home and took care of my child.  On the weekends, I worked as a maid at Holiday Inn.  I had two jobs, was a full-time University student, and I had a child to take care of.  I had no time to be a heroin addict!  I was a Pentecostal Christian fundamentalist.  I didn&#8217;t drink, I didn&#8217;t smoke, I didn&#8217;t allow it in my home.  My brother and his wife were living with me.  They weren&#8217;t allowed to drink or smoke in the home.  And yet, Colin Ross says, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I gave her all these drugs because she&#8217;s a heroin addict. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">What a crock!  But there it is, on my medical record.  And he keeps on saying that.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So you didn&#8217;t feel particularly mentally disturbed when you first went to see Colin Ross, but felt a definite worsening of your condition after therapy began?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The only thing that bothered me was </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">my foot</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  I just needed an extension of my unemployment insurance because my foot still hurt real badly, but the unemployment insurance had run out.  I thought, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">well this is really easy.  I&#8217;ll get it extended based on stress</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  So when I saw Colin Ross, the only actual problem I had was a very sore foot that had been injured.  There was nothing wrong with me mentally.  I was definitely stressed, but that&#8217;s because I was still working a part-time job.  I was still going to University full-time, and I was still a single mother, and I had almost no money to live on.  So, that was why I was stressed.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So clearly you were an out-patient.  How often did you see [Dr. Colin Ross], and what was the &#8220;therapy&#8221; at that point?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I saw him twice a week for an hour to two hours.  It was hypnotherapy.  He made some tapes for me to listen to all day.  He had me do &#8216;dream-imaging&#8217;, where at the end of each session he&#8217;d ask me to think about whether certain things had happened to me.  My homework was to go home and dream about these things.  I&#8217;d come back the next session and say, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I dreamed about those things, and this was what I was dreaming. </span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">And he would always say, </span></span><span style="color: #000000;">Those dreams you had are actually flash-backs of real events in your life. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">So it proceeded very quickly into insanity.  So about two months after I started seeing him, I was committed into the hospital&#8217;s Psych Ward.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So then you were an in-patient at that point.</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was committed, I was forcefully given injections of drugs, yes.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And for how long were you an in-patient?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was an in-patient for two weeks, and then I went back in-and-out, in-and-out for several years.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">What was your drugs regimen at that point?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was given antidepressants, I was given tranquilizers of various kinds.  At the end it was almost exclusively Halcion.  The last year I saw him, he switched me off of Halcion onto 320 milligrams of Valium per day<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/#footnote_1_675" id="identifier_1_675" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="&ldquo;The usual dose, depending upon severity of symptoms, is 2 milligrams to 10 milligrams 2 to 4 times daily.&rdquo; &ndash;http://www.drugs.com/pdr/valium.html .">2</a></sup></span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And all the while he was telling you to recall your dreams as memories?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He would give me something to think about.  I had homework to do.  He would plant the thought in my head that this is what I was supposed to try to see if I could remember.  Of course I would dream about it, because what else are you going to do when you&#8217;re deep in therapy?  When somebody tells you to think about this, you&#8217;ll go home and you&#8217;ll dream about it, you come back and you say, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I had this terrible nightmare about what you said.</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Ah, well, that&#8217;s a flash-back.  It really did happen.</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I would say to him, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I don&#8217;t remember that happening. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">The first time I saw him &#8211; the first visit, I told him &#8211; he asked, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">were you ever abused as a child? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">I was raised in the sixties by military parents, because my father was an aerial cartographer.  They were very strict.  I said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">what do you mean by abuse?  I mean, they were strict, but they never abused me. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">I made it very clear to him that my parents never, at any time, ever sexually abused me, or anybody.  But he said it was normal to deny it.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So eventually you were made to come to agree that you had been sexually abused?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was told by Colin Ross that I fit the description of somebody who was sexually abused&#8230; Even though I swore it never happened.  He said, you fit the description.  All people with MPD have been sexually abused [according to Colin Ross].</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I know about Colin Ross.  He has written [several </span><a id="yhn4" title="10 page summary of 'Bluebird' by Colin Ross" href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg"><span style="color: #ff0000;">conspiracy theory books</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">].  How specific was his story for you?  Did he develop a specific narrative for you that fit his conspiracy theory [and explained your supposed MPD]?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, absolutely.  As I said, my father was in the military.  This was when I was a tiny little girl, he was in the Air Force.  And for Colin Ross, for anybody who&#8217;s ever been in the military, he just makes the immediate leap into CIA, for crying out loud.  He asked me if the words &#8211; what was it? &#8211; &#8216;beta&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;gamma&#8217;&#8230; and, um&#8230; &#8216;omega&#8217;, I think it was [meant anything to me].  Those three.  He said that children were put in to CIA experiments where they used goggles on [the children&#8217;s] eyes and hypnotized [them].  [The CIA programmed personalities] were either one of those: beta, omega, alpha, one of those.  One [of these designations programmed the child so that they] would commit suicide, one would be given the job to dispense disinformation, the other was [&#8230;] an assassin.  I just thought &#8216;gamma&#8217; sounds too stupid, &#8216;alpha&#8217; sounds like alphabet soup, for crying out loud, I think I chose Omega, or something like that.  I chose the one that sounded the least stupid to me, because I was just trying to cooperate with him.  There was just no way you could argue with him.  He&#8217;d always just twist things around.  You couldn&#8217;t possibly argue with him.  He&#8217;d always just say that you fit the description, absolutely fit the description.  It has to be </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">this.</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></em></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So in his mind, you had to be Omega, or Gamma, etc.  You couldn&#8217;t be None of The Above?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">No.  Not at all.  No.  He was very much involved in [the idea of] </span><a id="hzqx" title="Colin Ross, projecting his own misdeeds upon the CIA" href="http://www.judgebusters.com/id183.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">CIA mind-control nonsense</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  And then he would give you jobs to do, homework to do at home.  You were supposed to close your eyes and you were supposed to visualize different parts of the city so that you could leave your body and travel around the city.  Then you&#8217;d come back for your next appointment and he&#8217;d say, So did you go anywhere?  Did you see anything for these out-of-body experiments he was putting you into?  I would say, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I don&#8217;t think I did.  I don&#8217;t know.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I tried the best I could.  You&#8217;d just try to please him so much because he just had this charisma, and you&#8217;d want to please this guy.  He was very affectionate with all of his patients.  He would give hugs, he&#8217;d rub your back and rub your legs.  In those days he was just so charismatic.  He was such a good-looking young psychiatrist.  All the nurses would just pander to him like puppies&#8230; So here we were: young women as MPD patients trying to please this handsome, young, charismatic guy who was giving [us] all of his affection.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So did he ever give any indication of where he was getting his ideas of government mind-control projects that were bringing patients in to him?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He never told me where he was getting that from.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">But he seemed to have a pretty specific idea of what [he felt] was going on?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He told me that he was the only MPD expert in Canada.  That he knew more than anybody else.  That they didn&#8217;t understand him.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And eventually he denied having ever given you drugs at all?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, he did!  One of the last times I saw him, I asked, Why did you give me all those drugs?  And he looked at me, and he said with a straight face, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I never gave you any drugs</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  I lived about a mile away from the hospital where I walked all the way home thinking, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I must be so crazy, so completely delusional.  Why would I think this if he never did [it]?</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I got to the drug store, and I went up to the pharmacist and I said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I know this is going to sound weird, but could you tell me if I&#8217;ve ever been given any drugs?</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> He looked at me, because he recognized me, of course, and he said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;ll print off some pages for you.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> He printed off reams and reams of pages for me.  Oh my goodness.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Why did he deny it?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I think he&#8217;d have to because it was &#8211; when I talked to a police officer a year later [he told me] &#8211; what [Colin Ross] did was criminal.  The amount of drugs Ross gave me was criminal.  [The officer] said if they could bring him into court they would charge him with </span><a id="ng3j" title="Legal Definition: administering noxious substances" href="http://www.lawteacher.net/PDF/Administering%20Offences.pdf"><span style="color: #ff0000;">administering noxious substances</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and endangering my life.  I never could get him into court though.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And you have long-term effects from the addiction?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I did have &#8211; I talked to </span><a id="jahi" title="Dr. Breggin's website" href="http://www.breggin.com/"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Peter Breggin</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> about that &#8211; I suffered with Halcion withdrawal, really seriously bad Halcion withdrawal for 10 years.  My family doctor, the neurologist, they&#8217;d all say, That&#8217;s impossible.  You can&#8217;t be suffering from withdrawal for that long.  It only lasts two weeks.  And then Peter Breggin gave me a copy of his </span><span style="color: #444444;"><a id="b6n1" title="Breggin Regarding Benzodiazepine" href="http://www.breggin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=66"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prolonged Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome</span></a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="color: #000000;">paper that he sent to the AMA.  It&#8217;s not as bad now as it was before.  This has been like 20 years.  Most of it is gone.  There is some side-effects: Loss of memory, loss of concentration, and if I get really tired I&#8217;ll start having seizures again.  And I do have fibromyalgia as a result of an accident: falling on the ice when I went to pick up my daily prescriptions.  The Pharmacist wouldn&#8217;t let me have more than 320 milligrams of Valium per day.  He wouldn&#8217;t do that.  I had to go all the way to the pharmacy, walk over there to pick up one day&#8217;s prescription at a time.  It was very icy.  Up here in Winnipeg, it&#8217;s very icy.  I started</span> having a seizure, and I fell on the ice, and I injured myself very badly.  I had to have several operations and I have fibromyalgia &#8211; constant pain for that.  One of the problems I have is I have a morbid fear of drugs now.  Just a horrible, morbid fear of drugs, so while the pain clinics and my family doctor want to give all sorts of pain medication, I won&#8217;t take it.  I&#8217;m just too afraid.  So I&#8217;m just going to be living in terrible constant pain for the rest of my life.</span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I was looking at the </span><a id="qnjk" title="Affidavit of Roma Elizabeth Hart" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/hart-affidavit-final"><span style="color: #ff0000;">affidavit you submitted</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to The Queen&#8217;s Bench &#8211; as it&#8217;s called in Canada &#8211; and it mentioned a&#8230;  sexual assault&#8230; in the hospital&#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  Isn&#8217;t that disgusting?  I think I already mentioned that he did illegal medical experiments on me.  He likes to do experiments, this guy.  He likes to do research.  Well, he knew.  He knew darn well that he was admitting into the hospital a dangerous sexual offender.  He knew who that man was because he came to me and told me, after I had been sexually assaulted&#8230; It was Christmas, and, um, I&#8217;d gone to a funeral.  I came back from the funeral, and I was terribly upset because my child&#8217;s father had died.  I couldn&#8217;t go to sleep, so I just sorted magazines just to calm myself down.  Everyone on the ward was a woman.  That ward was totally women, except for that evening, while I was at the funeral, Colin Ross admitted this sexual predator &#8211; offender &#8211; onto the ward.  He didn&#8217;t tell the nurses.  Didn&#8217;t tell the Hospital.  Didn&#8217;t tell me, that&#8217;s for sure.  I came in from the funeral   and I was sexually assaulted on the ward.  The next morning, Colin Ross says, O</span><em><span style="color: #000000;">h, I&#8217;m so sorry. Yes, I have 5 video tapes of this guy, and all the information about his sexual offenses.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> He said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">But I never thought he&#8217;d do that in the hospital.  I didn&#8217;t think he would.  <span style="font-style: normal;">[note: Following the interview Ms. Hart would amend this statement to say that Ross, in fact, did not apologize &#8211; rather, he told her that he believed her when she reported she had been assaulted]</span></span></em></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8230;Well, I just &#8211; I&#8217;m claiming.  This is just my claim [speculation].  I&#8217;m claiming that this was an experiment. </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Let&#8217;s just put this sexual offender on a ward of totally female [inhabitants], not tell them anything, and see what happens</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what happens:</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> He sexually assaulted me!</span></em></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">And I went to the press after that, when Colin Ross left my room.  I phoned the police and I phoned the newspaper, and then they contacted the hospital.  Later &#8211; it was a couple days later &#8211; </span><a id="bemz" title="St. B. hospital hit: 'sexual deviate' attacked woman" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/assault-article"><span style="color: #ff0000;">there was a front page news article about it</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  President of the hospital confirmed that </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, the man was prone to sexual assault, yes he was a dangerous offender.  Yes, that was all true. </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">And Colin Ross came in [my room].  He was furious.  He was absolutely livid.  He was just beat red.  He came into my room and he yelled at me and said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Get the Hell out of here! </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">But, you see, I was on such high levels of Halcion that if he had thrown me out that day, I would have died.  So, he had to take me off just enough so that I could get down to 320 milligrams of Valium instead.  And then </span><a id="c-h4" title="Assault Apology Request" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/assault-apology"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was kicked out of the hospital</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  On my own&#8230; Just to see if I&#8217;d live or die&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">With no referral to go elsewhere?</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, no.  Not at all.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And as I recall, it took you a while to find a psychiatric assessment after that.</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">After he [Colin Ross] left Winnipeg, I tried, and no one would take me on as a patient because &#8211; apparently&#8230; I did go into the hospital to have a cardiac test done.  When I was in the room with the cardiologist, he took my medical files on his desk &#8211; like a foot high &#8211; turned them around to face me so that I caould see them.  Then he left the room for about 10 minutes.  So I thought, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Well, okay &#8211; just out of curiosity.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I looked at the top paper, just at the top of the pile, and it was a letter from Colin Ross warning everyone not to treat me.  I have copies of all my medical records, but I don&#8217;t have that paper.  When I had all my medical records copied from the hospital, I paid about $700 dollars for all the papers, all the transcripts.  They wouldn&#8217;t copy that one.  I know it exists, because a cardiologist turned around so I could see it.   So, no, I couldn&#8217;t get anybody to help me.  And then after [Colin Ross] left, down to Dallas, and I filed a lawsuit against him, no one would see me at all.  So I went to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, talked to Pope, the guy in charge there.  He said he couldn&#8217;t force anybody to see me.  So I went to my family doctor who contacted the Minister of Health, Chomiak.  Now Chomiak arranged for me to go to London Ontario, because there was a psychiatrist out there who had formally debated Colin Ross &#8211; Known all about him.  And he had agreed to do a psychiatric assessment for me.  So I did have to get politicians involved, and there were arguments, during question period, on the floor to get me this kind of psychiatric assessment.  That&#8217;s how difficult it was to have done.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And it was Harold Merskey who did see you after that, right?</span></strong></p>

</div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">You decided to file suit against Colin Ross </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">after</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> he left for Texas?</span></strong></p>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">That&#8217;s right.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So what compelled him to leave for Texas?  I was looking at some of his [court] transcripts and I had fallen under the impression that it was a </span><a id="r-nc" title="trouble in Winnipeg" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/malpractise"><span style="color: #ff0000;">malpractice suit that had compelled him to leave</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> for Texas when he did.</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I sent you a copy of a </span><a id="u.30" title="Lack of funds forces expert out of province" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/ross-out-of-province"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Winnipeg Free Press article</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  In that Winnipeg Free Press article &#8211; this was 1991.  It says that there was quite a lot of hostility against Colin Ross.  The doctors in this city hated Colin Ross.  There&#8217;s this one time when I came out of one of my comas in the Victoria hospital.  Colin Ross worked at the St. Boniface hospital.  He wasn&#8217;t allowed to work at the Victoria hospital.  I was up in the ward and Colin Ross stopped by to visit me.  The doctor who was taking care of me came in and that was the first time in my life I ever heard two doctors yelling at each other out in the hall.  He just wanted Colin Ross to leave, and drop off the face of the Earth.  He was so angry.  There&#8217;s a lot of doctors who just can&#8217;t stand him up here.  They&#8217;re embarassed to say they even know who he is.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  Because he couldn&#8217;t get any funding.  Now, the Grey Nuns owned the St. Boniface Hospital.  Sister Jean Ell is a Psychologist, and she&#8217;d done a psychological assessment of Dr. Colin Ross &#8211; there were an awful lot of complaints &#8211; and she told the board at St. Boniface Hospital that it was </span><a id="m7sd" title="Correspondence regarding Sister Ell's assessment of Colin Ross" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/letter-to-jean-ell"><span style="color: #ff0000;">her opinion that he should be let go</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, but that they told her &#8211; the board at the Hospital &#8211; that he was bringing in a lot of research money.  So, in spite of everything &#8211; they agreed he was crazy &#8211; he was bringing in so much money.  It was only after the research grants dried up and he couldn&#8217;t get any more money, that&#8217;s when they told him to get out.  And that&#8217;s when he left.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And he still seems a bit crazy&#8230; to say the least.  In a personal correspondence with James Randi, Randi tells me about </span><a id="l7d-" title="Colin Ross's eye beams" href="http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2008/08/colin_ross_has_an_eyebeam_of_e.php"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Colin Ross&#8217;s eye beams</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, and how they were set to experiment this to either prove or disprove [Colin Ross&#8217;s assertion that he can project energy from his eyes].  Colin Ross backed out [of the experiment], said he&#8217;d get back to Randi, but never did.  So maybe he has sense enough to back out of such an experiment, but to have made the claim [that he could produce eye beams] at all &#8211; you really have to wonder &#8211;</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He has such a big ego though.  He doesn&#8217;t say that he&#8217;s wrong.  He just says that he needs to adjust his test for whatever the problem is.  He doesn&#8217;t admit he&#8217;s wrong.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Never!  Never!  He won&#8217;t retract it.  The Hospital &#8211; St. Boniface Hospital&#8230; The president, Dr. [Michel] Tetreault, wrote me a letter last year explaining that the hospital no longer endorses that, that diagnosis.  So </span><a id="z056" title="The Decline of MPD" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/mpd_did8.htm"><span style="color: #ff0000;">nobody would be diagnosed</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> with that [MPD] today.  But because Colin Ross won&#8217;t retract that diagnosis, </span><a id="q6kb" title="1994 letter from St. Boniface regarding misdiagnosis" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/the-diagnosis-stands"><span style="color: #ff0000;">they won&#8217;t take it off [my records]</span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Because it has to be the doctor that was treating you at the time that you were diagnosed.</span></div>

</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well, Dr. Harold Merskey, who certainly believes that I&#8217;ve never had MPD, ever &#8211; he certainly explains that in </span><a id="ybbl" title="Dr. Harold Merskey's assessment of Roma Hart" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/merskey-letter"><span style="color: #ff0000;">his psychiatric assessment</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> [of me] &#8211; what he wrote [in my psychiatric assessment] is that my [request] to have Multiple Personality Disorder removed should be granted.  And that was the best he could do, because that&#8217;s just the way hospitals work.  It has to be the doctor who treated you, the doctor who diagnosed you, that&#8217;s the one who has to take the diagnosis off.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">There was a point also where you went into Emergency in the same hospital you were receiving psychiatric care in, and they remanded you back to psychiatric.  How did that happen?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is when I was just a few days away from dying.  I was so terribly sick.  My blood pressure was down to 50 over 40, and there&#8217;s a walk-in clinic just across the parking lot from the psychiatric center that is at the St. Boniface Hospital.  Dr. Colin Ross wouldn&#8217;t allow me to see any doctors &#8211; the residents, the students that would come to the ward.  He wouldn&#8217;t let anybody see me, and he told the nurses to ignore me.  But I had passes.  I was allowed to leave.  So I almost crawled.  Part of the way, I did.  I crawled to the walk-in clinic and I saw a doctor there who told me, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">You need to go to emergency right away.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I told him, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;m already in the hospital</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  So he contacted the nurses on the floor, he sent me back, and half-way across the parking lot, a doctor stopped his car, put me in his car, and drove me up to the ward.  Colin Ross still refused to let the nurses treat me.  So I called the walk-in clinic doctor and I said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">You know, you called over here, and the nurses won&#8217;t help me</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  So he had to call Dr. Colin Ross himself.  Otherwise I would have died.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Did Colin Ross encourage you to take action against your parents under the assumption that they sexually abused you?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Yes.  When I was at my most insane, under the most drugs, he encouraged me to get a rifle and go up and shoot them. </span><a id="ujjf" title="Sworn affidavit regarding suicide deaths under Colin Ross's care" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/suicide-deaths"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He also encouraged me to kill myself</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> constantly, saying it would be quite understandable.  He would phone me late at night &#8211; and he did that to other patients too, because there was an MPD support group, and we&#8217;d all talk to each other and visit each other &#8211; he&#8217;d send us home with lethal amounts of drugs, phone us up at night, and encourage us to kill ourselves.  One of the reasons I figure he did that was because he had this interest in the &#8216;white-light&#8217; Near Death Experience.  So after we&#8217;d come out of comas, or what-not, from drug over-doses, the first thing he&#8217;d ask us was, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Well, did you see the light? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;">That&#8217;s all he was interested in.  Some of the other women died though.  But he really didn&#8217;t care about that.  He just said it was </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">fate.</span></em></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Well, beside encouraging you to shoot [your parents], did [Colin Ross] encourage you to take legal action?</span></strong></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Absolutely.  Oh. yes.  He also wanted me to sue one of my old family doctors from when I was a child who was the Governor General of Manitoba at the time&#8230; George Johnson<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/#footnote_2_675" id="identifier_2_675" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Correction: Dr. George Johnson wasLieutenant Governor of Manitoba, not Governor General">3</a></sup></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> , the Governor General who was a friend of my parents, because Colin Ross told me that he had other patients who claimed that the Governor General had sexually assaulted them when they were children.  And [Colin Ross] said, You really ought to sue.  I&#8217;ll help you.  And I said, I will if somebody else will.  Nobody else would, so George Johnson fortunately got away with not having to be dragged through the court system, the poor guy.</span></div>

</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I think that&#8217;s inevitable for me pretty soon.</span></strong></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">No.  Because I am on welfare disability, the only money I could raise for lawyers was just through begging people that I was given contact numbers for.  [I would be told] This lawyer hates [Colin Ross], this doctor hates him.  And this other man &#8211; his daughter died under Colin Ross&#8217;s care, and he helped me with some money too.  So I did manage to drag it through the system for 11 years with 4 different lawyers.  But, because my second to last lawyer did such an atrociously bad job &#8211; and </span><a id="g5-t" title="Claim of lawyer's incompetence" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/statement-of-claim-1"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he admitted to his negligence to the Law Society</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8211; it was dismissed due to delay.  And then Colin Ross&#8217;s lawyer managed to have the costs awarded against me.  So I owed Colin Ross something like 100 to 200 thousand dollars &#8211; something astronomical.  So I had to appeal that.  So I had to raise another 5 thousand dollars to appeal that, and then the Law Society threw in another 20 to 30 thousand dollars to pay the lawyer to help me appeal that, so I would have the costs removed.  And that was </span><a id="ces:" title="Judge Sinclair's order" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/judge-sinclairs-order"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Judge Sinclair&#8217;s order</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> that I sent down to you.  It says that, reason for dismissal due to delay, fault of my counsel.  And the costs were taken off.  I didn&#8217;t have to pay the costs.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I didn&#8217;t get too good of a chance to look over the [courtroom] transcripts [of a different suit brought against Dr. Colin Ross] you sent me today, but [from what I see, during the trial] somebody from an outside jurisdiction was saying that these charges brought against Colin Ross would certainly have his </span><a id="gk_8" title="&quot;he would have lost his license&quot;" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/malpractise"><span style="color: #ff0000;">medical license removed</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what case that was.  There were several pages missing.</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">That was Elizabeth Carlson.  She sued.  It was a 12 week trial in Minnesota.  She was the first to sue in any type of case like this.  And that was Christopher Barden.  Christopher Barden has his doctorate in Psychology, and he has a Law degree from Harvard.  He was the one who said that.  He read all of my hospital records.  The doctor who was an expert witness, Bodkin,</span><a id="tg5a" title="Letter from Dr. Bodkin" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/dr-bodkins-letter"><span style="color: #ff0000;">sent the affidavit</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> that said that it was grossly inappropriate the amount of drugs that Colin Ross had given me.  It&#8217;s just amazing.  It&#8217;s just amazing that he wasn&#8217;t charged.  It was very odd the way the police said it.  They said they wouldn&#8217;t charge him criminally until </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">after</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> the civil suit.  I don&#8217;t understand that at all.  I would just think that if someone would do a crime like that, they would just charge them.  But they said they wouldn&#8217;t do it until after the civil suit.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">None.  No.  All I can do is spend the rest of my natural life hounding him as much as I can, so I can expose him for the fraud that he is, and hopefully save the lives of as many people as I can.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;d put them on a billboard.  I don&#8217;t care.  I don&#8217;t want him to think that I&#8217;m ashamed of what happened, because I wasn&#8217;t responsible.  I was under an immense amount of hypnosis and drugs.  He is responsible.  I have no shame.  It seems so silly to say.  I am not going to be blackmailed into being quiet, or anything.  This is what he did, and he should be held accountable.  And he is just such a lying dog, I can&#8217;t stand it.  So, I make sure everybody knows what happened.  My lawsuit was never completed, unfortunately, but my hospital records still exist, and they&#8217;ve been used in other lawsuits for other people to have successful outcomes.</span></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">He set us all up in an MPD support group called the MPDers, and he tried to get us registered as a charity so we could go and raise money for him.</span></div>

</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">We were supposed to approach businesses, and he told us which ones &#8211; nice big ones &#8211; and we were supposed to approach businesses to raise money for his research.  And he was going to have us registered as a charity.  So that&#8217;s what his MPD patients were doing for him.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">And what exactly did he say his research was?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Multiple Personality Disorder and [that research into alleged] mind control experiments with the CIA &#8211; and Satanic Ritual Abuse, for crying out loud!  He explained this to me the first month I started seeing him.  There was a sign above the planetarium, and I saw it on my way to see him.  It was the silliest thing.  It was going toward Christmas and they were talking about the star of [Bethlehem], and that made [Colin Ross] start commenting about aliens.  The star [of Bethlehem, according to Colin Ross] wasn&#8217;t really the star of Jesus &#8211; it was an alien ship that they were really seeing.  So then he explained that lots of people had been abducted by aliens, and that women had been abducted by aliens and impregnated by aliens, and they have these alien babies.  Now, I think I already said to you that at that time when I started seeing him I was a Pentecostal Christian Fundamentalist.  I belonged to Church, was a Sunday School teacher.  All I could think was, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">How horrible!  How could God let that happen?  And what about the baby?  Would it have a soul?</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> So, in my mind, I was horrified.  Completely horrified.  I wouldn&#8217;t even talk about it.  I couldn&#8217;t even talk about it.  I just didn&#8217;t want to talk with anyone.  But then, a few years later &#8211; I think it was 1990, somewhere around then &#8211; he came up from a conference in Chicago.  He&#8217;d seen [infamous MPD therapist] </span><a id="q_.e" title="False Memory Syndrome Foundation Compilation: Dr. Bennett Braun" href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/braun.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bennett Braun</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and the International Association of Dissociation and MPD, and that.  He came in the hospital to see me and he said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, I have great news for you!</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> He was so excited, so happy and bubbly.  I looked at him and thought, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Good.  Great news.  What is it?</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> And he said,</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> You know that baby that you had?  The half alien baby?  It didn&#8217;t die! </span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> Thinking that it had died was [according to Colin Ross] the only way that I could resolve it in my mind, so that I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the soul.  So he thought for me, telling me that it didn&#8217;t die was going to be some good news.  I looked at him absolutely horrified.  I said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">What are you talking about?</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> At the conference he&#8217;d just been to, it had explained why all of the Satanic Ritual Abuse cases that they&#8217;d always talk about, where women give birth to these babies and they kill the babies &#8211; but nobody can ever find the bodies of these babies &#8211; [the conference Colin Ross attended explained that] the reason they can&#8217;t find the bodies of these babies is because the bodies of these babies are beamed up into spaceships, and they&#8217;re raised in the spaceships until they&#8217;re 18 years old.  Then they&#8217;re beamed back down to earth and given jobs with the CIA.  This is all to form a New World, and all that.  So it&#8217;s really the aliens who are impregnating the women, while they&#8217;re CIA mind-controlled, and then they give birth at Satanic rituals.  It&#8217;s a big circular thing.  It&#8217;s the craziest circular thing I ever heard in my life.  But I was horrified.  I burst into tears.  I couldn&#8217;t believe he just told me that my alien baby was alive.  But he was so confused.  He didn&#8217;t know why I wasn&#8217;t happy.</span></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is what </span><a id="oe4j" title="Wikipedia Entry: Dr. Richard Ofshe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ofshe"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr. Richard Ofshe</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> from Berkley told me back in 1994: If &#8211; and it&#8217;s not true of course, but </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">if</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8211; everything Colin said [regarding his conspiracy theories] was true, it would still not excuse anything that he did to me.  What he did to me was the worst case of medical malpractice that he had seen.  Really, he can&#8217;t excuse what he did by saying, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">Well look over here, look what they did in the CIA</span></em><span style="color: #000000;">.  Well, what they did in the CIA is the same thing [Colin Ross] does.  All the experiments, all the drugs, all the hypnosis, mind-control.  All the things that he says</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> look at what the CIA did</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> [about], they&#8217;re the very same things he did!</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I do find it funny that he actually wrote an article about the iatrogenic creation of Multiple Personality Disorder within the CIA, and I also see articles by people like </span><a id="e3o_" title="Hammond's absurd &quot;Greenbaum Speech&quot;" href="http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/greenbaum.htm"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Corydon Hammond</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who was trained in Neuro-Linguistic Programming, talking about how not to lead people to believe things that are not true.  They seem to be doing just the opposite, or exactly what they describe or proscribe to other people doing.</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The tapes he had me listen to &#8211; he made me hypnosis tapes &#8211; I&#8217;m walking around the University listening to these hypnosis tapes, and I&#8217;m taking these</span><strong></strong><span style="color: #000000;">drugs, and of course I couldn&#8217;t complete my courses, I had to drop out.  And it just made me completely crazy, all this mind-control, all day long, all night long, this constant mind-control.  The constant visits to his office.  It was just ridiculous. </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">That is</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> mind-control.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">&#8230;And the drugs, and the hypnotherapy.</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don&#8217;t know how he got away with the amount of the drugs he used.  He claimed it was okay, because I had questioned him about that.  I said, Are you sure this is safe?  I wasn&#8217;t completely stupid, I wanted to be sure it was safe.  He said, Oh, yes, yes, it&#8217;s perfectly safe.  Now, I&#8217;ve learned since then that he&#8217;s said the same thing to other patients: Oh, yeah, sure, it&#8217;s all safe, I checked it out.  Very same words to them.  But then I find out later, no, it was never checked out, no one ever approved it, no one ever did this before.  It was never safe.  He was just lying.  So any consent he ever got from anybody for any drugs he gave them was never informed consent.  So he&#8217;s violated the Nuremburg Code.  He&#8217;s violated the Nuremburg Code automatically by not getting informed consent, by doing illegal medical experiments on people with no informed consent.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So I&#8217;m still having trouble understanding what was it he believed was the therapeutic part of this?  You had your drugs, and you had your &#8216;homework&#8217; to remember things, but what then?  What, after remembering it?  Where was the effort to try and bring you back into unity with your &#8216;core self&#8217;, or your &#8216;real personality&#8217;, or whatever is they call it in the vernacular [of Multiple Personality Disorder]?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">There was no desire to help anybody.  There was only a desire to see how far you could get away with doing whatever you wanted to do.  It was treating us like white rats.  Some of the patients died.  With me, I got so completely insane, because of him.  So he had tried to have me locked up in a permanent psychiatric ward outside the city limits.  And that&#8217;s where you go when you&#8217;re like criminally insane.  He had tried to do that, but they wouldn&#8217;t take me.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">How did you come to the </span><a id="i1.t" title="False Memory Syndrome Foundation" href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/"><span style="color: #ff0000;">False Memory Syndrome Foundation</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> [FMSF]?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I was listening to the radio, and I heard that there were a couple of support group members on the radio, and they were talking about False Memory Syndrome.  It just sounded so much like what I had.  This was about a year after Colin Ross left, so&#8230; 1992.  Two years after he had left.  FMS wasn&#8217;t even formed as an idea of a syndrome until 1992, there were no support groups until 1993.  So it was &#8217;93 when I heard the radio program.  By the time that I&#8217;d found lawyers and doctors who could explain it to me, it was four months after the statute of limitations had expired.  So it took that long for me to understand that this was what was wrong, that this was what happened to me.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">It sounds like you had a falling-out with Colin Ross before you had a chance to revise your thinking about what had actually happened to you.  What was the process there?  How did you come back to reality?  What were you thinking?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I had lost my child to Child &amp; Family Service issues &#8211; put in foster care and hidden away from me.  Hidden away from her whole family, because Colin Ross had told them our whole family was involved in satanic ritual cults, killing children.  And my parents were supposedly high priests of this murderous satanic cult.  So CFS was </span><a id="gyt6" title="childhood satanic abuse checklist" href="http://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/checklist"><span style="color: #ff0000;">hiding her from the whole family</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.  I was desperately trying to get her back.  I was doing everything I possibly could.  I went back to University, I tried to ween myself back off of drugs.  I told Colin Ross that other doctors had told me that I was addicted to the drug he was giving me, Halcion.  He said, </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">No.  It&#8217;s impossible.  Can&#8217;t be addicted to Halcion.</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I tried to get off Halcion, tried to get off Valium, best I could, all by myself without any help.  And I had a court case coming up, and I didn&#8217;t want to be under care.  I just wanted to go to court looking as fit as I possibly could.  So I told Colin Ross that I couldn&#8217;t continue with the MPD therapy because I was fighting a custody battle, and the MPD therapy was making me too sick to fight my custody battle.  And he agreed with me!  That&#8217;s basically how it came to an end:  He agreed the therapy was making me too sick to fight for my child.  He was fed up with me as a patient anyway.  I was causing him nothing but trouble.((Note: After Ross&#8217;s infuriated reply to Roma Hart&#8217;s making public her sexual assault in St. Boniface Hospital while in his care, Hart was discharged from the hospital, but continued to see Ross on an out-patient basis. It was later that Ms. Hart sought to end her MPD therapy, and Ross, leaving Manitoba, failed to refer her elsewhere for psychiatric evaluation. This should clear up confusion that might be caused by what might otherwise sound like more than one permanent break made from Ross by Roma Hart.))</span></div>

</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">So you didn&#8217;t come to a </span><em><span style="color: #000000;">sudden</span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> realization that all this about Satanism and alien abduction was crap?  You kind of always had that feeling in the background to begin with?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well, I had read a magazine article where a woman said she thought she was MPD but really wasn&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t true.  I thought, Hmm, I wonder.  I read it and threw it away.  It wasn&#8217;t something I was using as evidence.  You know, I don&#8217;t still have it.  I read it and threw it away.  So there was that little thought in my mind.  But I was still worried my parents were going to kill me.  I was still quite certain that they belonged to a satanic cult, and they were going to murder me.  So I wasn&#8217;t out of the grip of this nonsense still.  I was still very fearful.  When I was sitting in my living room, in the apartment I had downtown, if lights flashed from the traffic, and they would flash on the windows, my heart would jump because I would think it was an alien spaceship or something.  I was still completely, totally crazy.  But there was still that one &#8216;maybe&#8217;.  So I would go back and forth thinking,</span><em><span style="color: #000000;"> Am I?  Am I not?  Am I crazy?  Am I delusional? </span></em><span style="color: #000000;"> I was very confused.  So desperately confused.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">But you eventually grew more skeptical of those claims.  Was it a slow process, or a realization?</span></strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span> </strong></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">In 1993 when I heard that radio program with the FMS support group &#8211; I contacted them, and they gave me a bunch of stuff to read.  I put it on top of my microwave.  I probably had a foot-high pile of stuff on my microwave.  I never read it.  I just put it in a pile, and I would never read it, because I was not quite sure that they weren&#8217;t a part of the satanic cult or not.  I didn&#8217;t know what was true and what was not true.  I was open-minded, but I was scared.  I was very scared.  Scared of my own shadow.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br />
</span></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">I do.  I do.  One of the few retractors that they have there.  Think they&#8217;ve got, maybe, a few hundred retractors.  So I&#8217;m open to anybody who&#8217;s been falsely accused, or wants to retract, or is interested at all.  I&#8217;m open to talk to anybody who wants to talk about it.</span></div>
