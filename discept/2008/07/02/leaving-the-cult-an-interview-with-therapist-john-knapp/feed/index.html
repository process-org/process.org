					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting interview.  He seems like he&#039;s on the right track as far as therapists go.  What&#039;s ironic is that I&#039;ve seen therapy that has been taken to the cult level.  Therapists who know all the new hip therapy techniques and speak in buzz words to the point of needing a translator.  How do you recover from that?  Go to a therapist because you went to a therapist?  I&#039;m one who&#039;s always been very skeptical of therapy and psychology because of the number of quacks and charlatans out there.  But this guys seems to have his shit together.

BTW: therapist also spells the rapist.]]></description>
