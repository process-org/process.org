					<description><![CDATA[People in various positions in our lives can turn a profit using our fear against us. And not just a monetary profit, they use us[our response to fear] for their own ends.                                                                                                                                              Reading the recountings of a former soldier, he described how having fear always gave him that extra edge . Fear has been a huge enemy in my life. I have let it take so much of my time and energy. Be a friend to yourself, I say.                  There is no pain like your own...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the reminder...You also reminded me of a funny statistic that I have read from a book entitled &#039;The Monster is Real&#039; by Yehuda Berg:

40% of the worries never materialized.

30% of the worries were about the past, were absolutely nothing could be done about them.

12% of the worries were about other peoples buisiness.

10% of the worries were spent on real or imaginary illness.

ONLY 8% of the worries were justified.

There can be healthy fears, or more so anxiety that can motivate people.

It is only when these fears are repetetive and control the person that they become unproductive.]]></description>
