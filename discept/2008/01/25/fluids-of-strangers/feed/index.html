					<description><![CDATA[Extremely amusing. I found myself chuckling with mirthful abandon. I dont know if Ive mentioned it before in our many conversations (which usually take place in my head) but Im something of an inventor in my home country. Indeed Im quite famous and have appeared on many prestigious programmes and conducted lecture tours on a diverse and interesting range of inventor type topics. You are most privileged in that I would like to share with you all one of my most well loved and popular designs. I have myself created what can be only be termed a &quot;spout&quot; (but in hushed tones is usually termed a little miracle) for use precisely at such occasions as described so wittily above, when urination on performers is not only appropriate but mandatory. As can be imagined,  trying to hit the glass with ones pants around ones ankles whilst swaying and holding a lighter aloft, the better to see Maria Carey&#039;s knickers, is, for a female, a precarious precedure at the best of times. Thus my Ladies WeeWee Tube (patent pending) fits snugly into your handbag/sock/pocket and can be discreetly manouevered into position when that magical moment arrives and the idea of dousing Maria in the contents of your bladder becomes irresistable. (And havent we all been there ..) Coming in 3 colour ways and costing as little as £6.50 + P&#038;P (thats $12 to you lot) the Ladies WeeWee Tube looks set to become this seasons must have desirable. I already have orders from some of the major Couture houses. If youd like a free one just let me know. I have a number in my garage. I also provide a handy water pistol (free of charge!) for transfer of that precious decanted peepee during those times when you need that extra power boost in order to squirt Maria right in the gob.]]></description>
