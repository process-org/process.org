					<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness Russ Hook, you say your friend who you actually lived with for three weeks was a  &quot;BIG TIME MPD&quot;  ! How hard that must have been on you Russ, certainly that experience along with the tons of on-line stuff you read must make you an expert on things like that eh ?
I know I sure feel like an expert on stuff like that after being a &quot;BIG TIME MPD&quot; once myself. Yes indeed, I spent five years as a patient of Dr.Colin Ross, the guy who wrote the forward to Judy Byington&#039;s book &quot;22 Faces&quot;, and I lived too tell all about it. Well that is actually pretty easy for me now that my friend Doug Mesner wrote that article about my experiences at the hands of my old psychiatrist Colin Ross. Check it out:
 http://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross-psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/
I can&#039;t say that I agree with anything you&#039;ve said in your comments but you sure have a way of putting the word &quot;Jew&quot; in everywhere you can, I never seen anything like it, but then I have never spent any time on any White Supremesist web sites. Well have a nice day Russ, I&#039;m glad to know that you&#039;re out there and I&#039;m way over here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have read &quot;Trance&quot; by Cathy O&#039;Brien, and lots of Springmeier&#039;s stuff, as well as Brice Taylor&#039;s book. Then tons of stuff over 15 years about MK on-line. The victim I actually lived with for 3 hellish weeks was BIG TIME MPD. When I told her she was a MK victim, her memories of abuse, and SRA came flooding back to her. The stories she told me after were corroborated with what I had read previously, years before. Of course she was a whore, and in the sex trade b/c all of the females, and some male victims are programmed for that to earn money for these satanic sickos. I saw a little girl personality also, and a intelligent one too. I think she was programmed for legal work.
 Using logic, common sense, and being able to read LIARS like yourself is also a gift I have.lol It&#039;s frustrating trying to deceive someone who is ON to you, and knows his stuff isn&#039;t it?  The POS who perpetrate this, and the ones who try to protect them are the lowest SCUM on the Planet. How does that feel? OOps, I forgot, the JEW has no compassion, and fakes emotion, but is an excellent LIAR, CHEAT.

					<description><![CDATA[As for dodged questions directly relevant to the topic here, here&#039;s the breakdown:

-- Has your experience of supposedly meeting 2 people victimized by MK-Ultra shown you the reality of all these items of supernaturalism? 

-- Or are you simply obligated to believe any claim, no matter how irrational, if only a Jewish enemy is invoked?

-- And what of the narrative discrepancies in the book? Were you able to reconcile those?

-- levitation is a “symptom” [of MK-Ultra]? 

-- How is being born under the auspice of prophecy a result of MK-Ultra? 

-- How is divine intervention [a result of MK-Ultra]? 

--What of demonic possession? If that’s a side-effect of MK-Ultra programming, why did the CIA make it so susceptible to the exorcising prayers of Mormon Church officials?

-- You say that “MK Ultra is real, so is SRA”, and so, by extension, this book (which you’ve never read, by your own admission) is necessarily a true story?

-- Leaving the problem of definition aside, let’s just assume you’re right (against all odds) and that whatever you mean when you say MK-Ultra and SRA really are cold realities. Just for argument’s sake, you can have that. So what does that mean for my criticisms of this book?

-- Let’s put it like this, Nick: Say I were to tell you that a werewolf stole the horn off of my pet unicorn’s head? Would you believe me? If you did not, on the grounds that perhaps you feel that unicorns and werewolves don’t exist (I’m giving you an unearned benefit of the doubt), would it be appropriate for me to chastise you and shout that you are trying to “suppress” the fact that theft exists?

So it seems all the dodging has been on your end. But then, you&#039;ve not read the book either, and now you&#039;re trying to shift senselessly to another topic...]]></description>
