					<description><![CDATA[On May 22, 2010 at 9:22 pm,  &quot;Kali&quot; posted a lengthy defense of  &quot;The Ross Institute&quot;, (above),  which contains many questionable claims.

Doug really gave you the &quot;kid glove&quot; treatment, Kali.  No doubt, he sincerely wanted to hear more of your story and didn&#039;t want to scare you off by confronting those claims. I have no idea if the two of you ever had further communications or not.

Well, it&#039;s been over a year since you posted that here...time for me to call bullsh*t on it.

Specifically, this:
 
&quot;In 2005, I became a federal whistle blower and testified before federal agencies about the programs to create personalities within myself that were Alpha, Theta, Beta and Delta based. After testifying, the federal agencies did say that my testimony was not questioned, the problem was that no agency wanted to take credit for it. Each agency said it was another agency’s fault&quot;.

is a lie - and you are a liar! 
I have a copy of  &quot;subproject 136&quot;  - I&#039;m looking at it right now - and YOU ARE A LIAR, Kali. 

Some who have posted comments here are merely confused. After quacks like Ross messed their heads up, some may be genuinely incapable of telling fact from fiction. But that&#039;s not the case with you.  You know very well what you are doing,  your deception is voluntary and intentional. That&#039;s reprehensible, to say the least.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a disturbing article! 

It must be a huge relief to Ross&#039;s surviving victims and their families to know that someone has taken the time to thoroughly research and record at least some of Ross&#039;s abusive activities.  

I hope this is at least some small consolation to them. 

If there is any justice in the world Colin Ross would spend the rest of his miserable life in jail.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aser, the reason this focuses on satanism (ritual abuse of the 1980s) and mind control is because they are conspiracy theories that are difficult to grab and see clearly. They are circular arguments, and can be interpreted by individuals differently, they are amorphous, and they ask us to prove a negative putting the burden of proof on the questioner, rather on the one contending they have information - I can go on, but I think you get the drift.

Thanks for your comments. JB]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for  this. Great. Not just the usual bullshit but things that make sence and good conversation on the topic. 
The thing I wonder is why all of this theories focus on satanism and mind control out of hundreds of religious organisations and programs where in fact there are a lot more reasonable evidence and real cases of abuse. 
   For example I know very real people and cases from the Beatitudes, the Hare Krishna and from ultra religious Jewish sects. Or we can mention the lots of christian organisations newborn christians believers. Or the catholic church. Almost all religious sects have some ugly issues. But thats only becouse there are many ugly people. 
   
Becouse this name was dedicated for all the negative and bad qualities. But its so naiv to fall to an idea like this. 
I can almost say its like an IQ test.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

To say I&#039;m sorry you went through that would hardly be fitting.  I was tortured by a psychiatrist who was a colleague of Ross&#039; who did truth serum interviews, tied me to beds every day, and I took so many meds back then it&#039;s criminal.

As you mentioned, the manner in which I was treated as a patient is against the Geneva Conventions regarding how a prisoner of war is allowed to be treated according to International Law. I wish I knew that fact when I sued the doctor and hospital. Why that man and those who run that hospital aren&#039;t serving prison sentences is beyond my comprehension.

Glad you found us. I&#039;m sure Doug won&#039;t mind - you can also visit my blog &quot;multiple personalities don&#039;t exist&quot; and also find Roma Hart. She has made posts on this blog. She too, was abused by Ross.

Best to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[April 19, 2011,
Wanting to sue Ross myself, so physically sick and &quot;MECICINE&quot; &quot;induced  mental illness&quot; , for past 25 years!! All I needed was some good therapy, and I&#039;d have been fine!  But of course you have to be on &quot;meds.&quot;........  Been on over 50 psych meds.!! AND SHOCK THERAPY!! Anyone on ANY PSCYCH MED should read the previously mentioned DR&#062; PETER BREGGIN.  FINALLY FORCED BIG PHARMA TO PUT ALL THE HORRIFIC PERMANANT MANY OF THEM  &#038; COMMON ***&quot;SIDE EFFECTS&quot;.  This info I just came across 2 months ago, and has explained why, My brain is permantly damaged, my live is in shambles, along with the hell, I, my family, relation, friends, etc., have went though because of the &quot;THEROY&quot; of &quot;CHEMICAL IMBALANCE&quot;, that has replaced good Cognitive Behavioral, Dialectical Behavioral and Legitimate Trauma Therapys.  Now, MY PHYSICAL HEALTH HAS ME BEDRIDDEN AT 47, with NO SUPPORT, because no one understands, or wants to deal with MENTAL illness.  I had MENTAL ILLNESS, as it was &quot;INDUCED&quot; by the very medications, used in HIGH DOSES AND MANY COMBINATIONS!!  THEN PATIENTS HAVE LESS &quot;RIGHTS&quot; THAN A CRIMINAL&#060; AND THEY ALWAYS BLAME A PATIENT FOR ACTING MANIC&#060; NEUROTIC&#060; PSYCHOTIC, when that&#039;s why they came to hospital in the first place!! FOR HELP&#060; AND END UP ABUSED!!

I&#034;M so glad to find VALIDATION against this horror of a man!  Actually my experience in 25 years of many psychiatrists, is that 90% of them really don&#039;t even like people!! NOT PSYCOLOGISTS, necess. but psych. never agree with one another.  They all will always change your meds to their own &#034;concoction&#034; (sp?).  They treat you like you are the stupidest idiot on earth.  They are rude, inconsiderate, and make you cry if ness. and then demand (25 yrs ago) 150 per 1 1/2 hr., even if you hated their service, and don&#039;t want to pay for their abuse!!
It&#039;s ALWAYS THE PATIENTS FAULT!!!!
THEY WILL ALWAYS COVER UP ANY THING THEY OR A HOSPITAL DOES, AND LIE THEIR A** OFF ABOUT THE PATIENT&#060; WHO IS USUALLY BOMBED OUT OF THEIR MINDS, or 1/2 BOMBED OUT!!  THEY &#034;INDUCE&#034; YOUR BEHAVIOR JUST BANG I&quot;M GUILTY, EVEN THOUGH I HAD &quot;PROOF&quot; I WAS INNOCENT!! EVEN SAID I &#039;ABUSED STAFF&#039;--SHE WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO ME!! If I&quot;D HAVE WANTED TO ABUSE HER, SHE WOULD HAVE HAD PICTURE PROOF&#060; BELIEVE ME&#060;THEY LIE LIKE RUGS!!  SO THEY ARE ARE &#034;CHARGING&#034; ME WITH ASSAULT&#060; WITH NO NOTATION OF WHAT EVEN SUPPOSEDLY OCCURED!!  I HAVE NO LAWYER TO REPRESENT ME!! SO NOW MY RECORDS &#034;GUILTY&#034; W/ NO WAY TO &#034;LET&#034; ME PROVE INNOCENT!! PATiENT AVOCATES ARE A JOKE.

THIS MAN SAID MY MANIA, I FELT WAS LIKE  A &#034;MONSTER&#034;.  HE SAID IT  WASN&#039;T REALLY A MONSTER, I WAS REALLY TALKING ABOUT &#034;MYSELF&#034;====I&#034;m a MONSTER!!

HAS HE EVER BEEN MANIC?? DOES HE KNOW HOW HORRIBLY IT RUINS YOUR LIFE AND ALL THOSE WHO LOVE &#038; DEAL WITH YOU???
NO MY MANIA ISNT A MONSTER****I&#034;M THE MONSTER!!!

HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU READ THAT ABOUT YOURSELF IN YOUR NOTES???  AND THIS IS THEREPUTIC??

I have been to the State hospital in Kalamazoo, MI one of the 2 or 3 in the whole state left 3 times, so I know what hell is.  They are all EVIL.
Most of the time the older workers, few younger, are genuinely nice and helpful. But many just work their for the $$ and since you are dropped to a &#034;patient&#034; and not a &#034;paying customer&#034; status, you are ripe for people who love to be abusive in all forms.

So I wanted to bring MAJOR attention to the **NEW released drug &#034;SIDE EFFECTS&#034;, as MENTAL ILLNESS has risen just in the last decade 700%!!!!! WHY??**BECAUSE THEIR &#034;MEDICINES&#034; &#034;INDUCE&#034; THESE ILLNESS &#038; BEHAVIORSS (won&#039;t EVEN go into Amphetamines give to CHILDREN, STRONGER THAN COCAINE!!)&#060;WHICH PROVIDE MORE INCOME THAN THEY CAN EVEN KEEP UP WITH.

TRY TO DO LEGITIMATE THERAPY WHILE YOUR PSYCHOTIC!!  THEN THEY SAY YOUR &#034;BORDERLINE&#034; ***THAT&#034;S A FAVORITE!!!  WHEN THE &#034;MEDS&#034; NOW STATE THAT THE SIDE EFFECTS CREATE &#034;BORDERLINE&#034; (behavior), &#034;MIXED BI POLAR&#034; AND &#034;MANIA&#034; AND &#034;HYPO_MANIA&#034;!!!!!!!!!!!

I&#039;m so glad to VERY UNFORTUNETLY read the horrors this man alone has done, not to mention the MANY MANY OTHERS!!!  BUT at least I have validation, I&#039;m NOT &#034;CRAZY&#034; or a &#034;MONSTER&#034;.  And hopefully what these poor people have went though with this &#034;Horror of a man&#034;, which &#034;Charisma&#034; (boy they are right on that one, it&#039;s like setting with the great &#038; powerful &#034;OZ&#034;, where he treats, he&#039;s on a GOD like pedistal, and WILL NEVER ADMIT HE&#039;S WRONG, NO PSYCH. I&#034;VE EVER RAN INTO WILL (not that their aren&#039;t some, I&#039;m just saying as a group, they are the RUDEST, NARCISTIC bunch of money, domination and almost REVERENCE hungry lot I&#039;ve met!!  That have so much LEGAL POWER OVER YOUR LIFE!! ITS HORRIFYING!!

Like the others mentioned, HE BLACK BALLS PEOPLE, and they ALL mostly STICK TOGETHER, except they secrectly all have their own adgenda&#039;s and argue &#038; fight about &#034;diagnois&#039;&#034;(sp?).  Only PROBLEM IS, with their power, they lie and can basicly imprison you by their notations, because, PSYCH paitents ALWAYS LIE, and are ALWAYS WRONG!!!  SO THE GREEN RIVER KILLER HAD 2-3 LAWYERS, but Psych patients, unless they have family &#038; $$$$ they won&#039;t TOUCH YOUR CASE, AS YOU ARE UNRELIABLE.  BASICLY YOU ARE REDUCED TO LOWER THAN A PRISONER, WHO&#039;S ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AGAINST ANOTHER!!  

If your not &#034;crazy&#034; when you go in the system, you will be by time you get out!!!!!!!!!!

IF YOU JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE &#034;MEDS&#034; THAT MIGHT &#034;TEMORARILY&#034; WORK, YOU BRAIN WILL ALWAYS BECOME TOLLERANT OF THEM&#034;, and they will stop working, so they can then THOW you on some MORE!!

IF you can just stick to therapy, if can&#039;t afford GOOD therapist, LOTS of GOOD therapy CBT, DBT &#038; TRAUMA, PTSD, ETC., that have REASONABLE&#060; PRACTICAL THERAPY&#034;S------DO THAT INSTEAD OF GETTING SUCKED INTO THE SYSTEM!!!


MY LAST COMMENT.  IN MY 25 years of GROUP&#060; ROOMATES&#060; FELLOW PATIENTS MET, ****EVERYONE IS AN INDIVIDUAL****!!!!.  SOME DO &#034;DISASSOCIATE&#034;, MY mom who was horribly abused, NEVER went to a PSYCH, but since I was little I&#039;ve SEEN HER DO IT.  She said in school, she hardly ever talked, but always got in trouble for &#034;DAYDREAMING&#034;.  THAT&#039;s what they used to call it.  I DONT HAVE THAT ABILITY, I REMEMBER EVERTHING IN VIVID DETAIL.

SO FOLKS&#060; EVERYTHING IS NOT BLACK &#038; WHITE!!  PEOPLE ARE ALL DIFFERENT!!!!  SO KEEP THAT IN MIND IN DEALING WITH EACH OTHER ONE EVERY LITTLE THING.......

UNFORTNATELY SMART PEOPLE&#060; WHO PASS A TEST &#038; BECOME A DOCTOR OF ANYKIND CAN BE EVIL, OR HELPFUL.. IT&#039;s JUST THAT THEY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE SO THEY ARE VERY PROTECTED ---AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME, ENERGY AND $$ TO WIN AGAINST THEM, AND EVEN THEN&#060; THEY ARE ONLY __MAYBE PUT ON &#034;PROBATION&#034;, AND HARDLY EVER EVER REVOLKE (sp) THEIR LICENSE!! THEN THEY JUST RUN SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PRACTICE AS THE STATES DON&#039;T EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK!!! BUT IF YOU GET A DRIVING TICKET&#060; OR MISDEMEANOR, THE AVERAGE &#034;JOE&#034;, HIS INFORMATION IS ALWAYS TRACABLE ALL OVER THE WORLD!!

But at least with this site, hopefully it gives me amunition, but I&#039;m on disabilty also, and no lawyer will touch me because of no $$!!!

But just validation is very helpful, thank you all very much for your stories, however you experience it, it&#039;s painful for you.
Don&#039;t let your &#034;DIAGNOIS&#034; BE YOUR IDENTITY :)

THere I think I&#039;m done!!! Thank you all!!]]></description>

WHY??**BECAUSE THEIR &quot;MEDICINES&quot; &quot;INDUCE&quot; THESE ILLNESS &amp; BEHAVIORSS (won&#039;t EVEN go into Amphetamines give to CHILDREN, STRONGER THAN COCAINE!!)&lt;WHICH PROVIDE MORE INCOME THAN THEY CAN EVEN KEEP UP WITH.</p>
<p>TRY TO DO LEGITIMATE THERAPY WHILE YOUR PSYCHOTIC!!  THEN THEY SAY YOUR &quot;BORDERLINE&quot; ***THAT&quot;S A FAVORITE!!!  WHEN THE &quot;MEDS&quot; NOW STATE THAT THE SIDE EFFECTS CREATE &quot;BORDERLINE&quot; (behavior), &quot;MIXED BI POLAR&quot; AND &quot;MANIA&quot; AND &quot;HYPO_MANIA&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I&#039;m so glad to VERY UNFORTUNETLY read the horrors this man alone has done, not to mention the MANY MANY OTHERS!!!  BUT at least I have validation, I&#039;m NOT &quot;CRAZY&quot; or a &quot;MONSTER&quot;.  And hopefully what these poor people have went though with this &quot;Horror of a man&quot;, which &quot;Charisma&quot; (boy they are right on that one, it&#039;s like setting with the great &amp; powerful &quot;OZ&quot;, where he treats, he&#039;s on a GOD like pedistal, and WILL NEVER ADMIT HE&#039;S WRONG, NO PSYCH. I&quot;VE EVER RAN INTO WILL (not that their aren&#039;t some, I&#039;m just saying as a group, they are the RUDEST, NARCISTIC bunch of money, domination and almost REVERENCE hungry lot I&#039;ve met!!  That have so much LEGAL POWER OVER YOUR LIFE!! ITS HORRIFYING!!</p>
<p>Like the others mentioned, HE BLACK BALLS PEOPLE, and they ALL mostly STICK TOGETHER, except they secrectly all have their own adgenda&#039;s and argue &amp; fight about &quot;diagnois&#039;&quot;(sp?).  Only PROBLEM IS, with their power, they lie and can basicly imprison you by their notations, because, PSYCH paitents ALWAYS LIE, and are ALWAYS WRONG!!!  SO THE GREEN RIVER KILLER HAD 2-3 LAWYERS, but Psych patients, unless they have family &amp; $$$$ they won&#039;t TOUCH YOUR CASE, AS YOU ARE UNRELIABLE.  BASICLY YOU ARE REDUCED TO LOWER THAN A PRISONER, WHO&#039;S ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AGAINST ANOTHER!!  </p>
<p>If your not &quot;crazy&quot; when you go in the system, you will be by time you get out!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>IF YOU JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE &quot;MEDS&quot; THAT MIGHT &quot;TEMORARILY&quot; WORK, YOU BRAIN WILL ALWAYS BECOME TOLLERANT OF THEM&quot;, and they will stop working, so they can then THOW you on some MORE!!</p>
<p>IF you can just stick to therapy, if can&#039;t afford GOOD therapist, LOTS of GOOD therapy CBT, DBT &amp; TRAUMA, PTSD, ETC., that have REASONABLE&lt; PRACTICAL THERAPY&quot;S&#8212;&#8212;DO THAT INSTEAD OF GETTING SUCKED INTO THE SYSTEM!!!</p>
<p>MY LAST COMMENT.  IN MY 25 years of GROUP&lt; ROOMATES&lt; FELLOW PATIENTS MET, ****EVERYONE IS AN INDIVIDUAL****!!!!.  SOME DO &quot;DISASSOCIATE&quot;, MY mom who was horribly abused, NEVER went to a PSYCH, but since I was little I&#039;ve SEEN HER DO IT.  She said in school, she hardly ever talked, but always got in trouble for &quot;DAYDREAMING&quot;.  THAT&#039;s what they used to call it.  I DONT HAVE THAT ABILITY, I REMEMBER EVERTHING IN VIVID DETAIL.</p>
<p>SO FOLKS&lt; EVERYTHING IS NOT BLACK &amp; WHITE!!  PEOPLE ARE ALL DIFFERENT!!!!  SO KEEP THAT IN MIND IN DEALING WITH EACH OTHER ONE EVERY LITTLE THING&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>UNFORTNATELY SMART PEOPLE&lt; WHO PASS A TEST &amp; BECOME A DOCTOR OF ANYKIND CAN BE EVIL, OR HELPFUL.. IT&#039;s JUST THAT THEY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE SO THEY ARE VERY PROTECTED &#8212;AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME, ENERGY AND $$ TO WIN AGAINST THEM, AND EVEN THEN&lt; THEY ARE ONLY __MAYBE PUT ON &quot;PROBATION&quot;, AND HARDLY EVER EVER REVOLKE (sp) THEIR LICENSE!! THEN THEY JUST RUN SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PRACTICE AS THE STATES DON&#039;T EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK!!! BUT IF YOU GET A DRIVING TICKET&lt; OR MISDEMEANOR, THE AVERAGE &quot;JOE&quot;, HIS INFORMATION IS ALWAYS TRACABLE ALL OVER THE WORLD!!</p>
<p>But at least with this site, hopefully it gives me amunition, but I&#039;m on disabilty also, and no lawyer will touch me because of no $$!!!</p>
<p>But just validation is very helpful, thank you all very much for your stories, however you experience it, it&#039;s painful for you.<br />
Don&#039;t let your &quot;DIAGNOIS&quot; BE YOUR IDENTITY 🙂</p>
<p>THere I think I&#039;m done!!! Thank you all!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I have not read all of the comments because there are so many and I will come baqck, but I want to add my two cents:

This MPD stuff was very popular with the women&#039;s center volunteers because they could shove it through and accuse men, women&#039;s fathers, of rape and thus increase their whole raison d&#039;etre. 

My experience was that I was trying to get my brother-in-law charged for molesting and continuing to harass me. It was not a weird ritual, it was a regular horny guy who thought it was real cool that his wife had a kid sister.  So I was referred to the local women&#039;s center  which had been inserted into the police system for screening people. Volunteers with six-weeks training in politics would act as the screeners.  I had a few friendly conversations with one of them (I am telling only part of the story for brevity&#039;s sake) and she asked me about my childhood and I told an anecdote about having a weird  reaction to a Dali painting, and she interrupted me and told me that proved I actually was raped by my father and my brother-in-law was a false memory to hide the true memory! (key to this: my sister was donating to the women&#039;s center and I had tried to tell myself that would not impact me) This volunteer had listened until she could find just any silly anecdote to hang father-rape on! And to absolve &quot;normal&quot; sexual assaulters.  I told her she was nuts, I was a young teen (12-13) when the abuse started and I knew darn well exactly who did it and what happened. My father was a sweet and loving man who never hurt his children. But they were hell-bent to prevent me from pressing charges against my brother-in-law.

Another incident, same county, same &quot;health&quot; network: I was going to a group therapy for stress (living in the same area as said brother-in-law and being a single mother, etc) and I made a short trip into Canada for a vacation. I am from French-Canadian heritage. Upon return, I had picked up the old family accent and one of the two therapists in the group noticed it and pointed it out and I laughed and said &quot;yes, I just got back ffrom Quebec.&quot; but that therapist tried to start constructing an MPD diagnosis and I had to argue that it is not at all unusual for ethnic-Americans to shift accents when visiting back in their other language and we are perfectly aware of who we are, the same person, all the time.  I swear, I think those shrinks believed that people who speak two languages have MPD!!!  and in that semi-rural county, the fashion of the moment (that was apparently dominated by people like Ross) was all anyone could get in terms of treatment or help for any kind of stress or family problems. That was late eighties and early nineties.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[doug,

For certain, many in SMART think that I am in &quot;denial&quot; of my &quot;true reality.&quot;  I am certainly &quot;tied in&quot; with all the right groups in their opinions - the CIA, FBI, military, and more.  My husband is a master Mason.  I am a Rosicrucian (and darn proud of it!!) and sit on 2 international research boards through these &quot;secret society&quot; groups.  One SMART member exclaimed in horror, after finding out the types of curriculum I studied at the special government school I attened, &quot;oh my god! &quot;They&quot; aren&#039;t even trying to HIDE their agenda with you or others like you!!&quot; I find that funny because I look back at my life and don&#039;t see anything in it that would lead me to believe me or anyone else in my life is killing babies or torturing anyone.  My research is based upon HELPING PEOPLE, not killing or controlling them.  

I don&#039;t pass judgement on other people&#039;s experiences because I have not walked in &quot;their shoes.&quot;  However, I once had a very good friend who did a past life regression with a psychotherapist.  He came back from the session convinced that he had lived in the 13th century around Germany.  He had a whole slew of &quot;facts&quot; that he could remember from this supposed &quot;past life.&quot;  I listened politely to him recount what he remembered.  Then, I slowly began to point out the obvious inconsistencies of his recounting.  For example, he felt he had two children (Ashley and Matthew) and a wife (Michelle).  I clearly pointed out to him that those are 20th century names.....not 13th century Germania.  He also spoke about eating potatoes at a meal.  I kindly pointed out that potatoes weren&#039;t brought to Europe until the early 18th century, well after the time period when he supposedly &quot;lived.&quot;  Needless to say, my &quot;comments&quot; on his experience were not well received.  

I guess when people hold onto a &quot;scenario&quot; that they believe is their reality, they are very defensive of it and see any other opinion as a direct assault.  Do I believe that I am a victim of RA/MC?  No, I don&#039;t....  Do I believe I may be DID?  Well, I&#039;m not 100% sure on that one (due to some other incidents that I have not explained in my posts), but I don&#039;t really think so.  Do I believe that I am somehow involved in some insidious, multi-generational conspiracy?  Not likely...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thank you for commenting, &quot;phoenix&quot;.
you raise an interesting point when you say: &quot;if such a system [of Ritual Abuse and Mind Control] did exist, how can any individual every be completely sure that they are not being &#039;accessed&#039; again? The answer I’ve received is always the same – &#039;I can’t…&#039; Doesn’t that answer still keep you ultimately enslaved – rhetorically speaking?&quot;
no doubt, it does.  those who still subscribe to the idea of methodical, amnesia-inducing traumas being forced upon their victims by this presumed conspiracy would say that you are in &quot;denial&quot;.  even if this were the case, and -- contrary to all predictions based on how the mind works -- you had forgotten some traumas that provided the vital link to a massive conspiracy, what is your alternative?  you either live in &quot;denial&quot; or you obsess for the rest of your days, speculating as to the nature, the movements, and the ultimate design that motivates this evil underworld -- an underworld which is so effective and insidious, that your revolt against it would mean nothing.  this is hardly a world-view that can be best expected to promote your on-going well-being.
i have received some e-mails regarding the recovered memory articles that i have posted here from people who are still quite convinced that they were victims of satanic mind-control.  some of these emails have sought to convince me that the recovery of these memories has proven a most effective therapy, that before realizing this &quot;truth&quot; of their victimization within a cult, they were confused and disturbed.  the narrative of abuse at the hand of a hidden enemy may have given these people a sense-of-purpose, and may have given them a context in which to frame their lives during a confusing time, but in exchanging messages with these people, i find that each one of them expresses a good deal of doubt and paranoia.  they still worry about being tracked, worry for their children&#039;s safety (unreasonably), and seem rather trapped in this deleterious reality-frame wherein the important events, the most vital happenings, are taking place behind their backs, under their noses, but without so much as a trace scent.  everything, it seems, is waiting to collapse around them, and they are too paralyzed (for lack of definite information) to act on their own behalf.  of course, one can never prove a negative, but there isn&#039;t evidence to support the existence of such a conspiracy, and more than enough evidence to indicate that it isn&#039;t there.  in any case, i strongly feel that these individuals would do best to forget the whole business, concentrate on their own daily lives, and not oppress themselves with feverish speculation as to what invisible forces may be conspiring to do next.  
it is encouraging to hear that you were able to come to this on your own, even in a social environment where anecdote and embellishment seem to be taken as concrete fact.  clearly, the &quot;self-doubt&quot; that found you expelled was triggering similar doubts in others, and it is a toxic group environment that does not tolerate reasonable questions to the answers.  i hope others still involved in such networks eventually display your fortitude....]]></description>
