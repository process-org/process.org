He is a best-selling author of vitriolic anti-atheist screeds that declare non-believers to be unintelligent, lacking in the sixth sense &#8211; Common Sense, the &#8220;sense&#8221; that apparently puts intuition and gut-feeling above reason and science.  With actor Kurt Cameron, Comfort runs a ministry, <a href="http:///"><span style="color: blue;">Way of the Master</span></a>, which sports its own Evangelism Training Academy and television programme.  He is president, founder, and CEO of Living Waters Publications with a stated mission to &#8220;inspire in every Christian a God-glorifying passion to fulfill The Great Commission&#8221;.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id="_x0000_t75"  coordsize="21600,21600" o:spt="75" o:preferrelative="t" path="m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe"  filled="f" stroked="f"> <v:stroke joinstyle="miter" /> <v:formulas> <v:f eqn="if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0" /> <v:f eqn="sum @0 1 0" /> <v:f eqn="sum 0 0 @1" /> <v:f eqn="prod @2 1 2" /> <v:f eqn="prod @3 21600 pixelWidth" /> <v:f eqn="prod @3 21600 pixelHeight" /> <v:f eqn="sum @0 0 1" /> <v:f eqn="prod @6 1 2" /> <v:f eqn="prod @7 21600 pixelWidth" /> <v:f eqn="sum @8 21600 0" /> <v:f eqn="prod @7 21600 pixelHeight" /> <v:f eqn="sum @10 21600 0" /> </v:formulas> <v:path o:extrusionok="f" gradientshapeok="t" o:connecttype="rect" /> <o:lock v:ext="edit" aspectratio="t" /> </v:shapetype><v:shape id="Picture_x0020_1" o:spid="_x0000_i1025" type="#_x0000_t75"  style='width:.75pt;height:.75pt;visibility:visible;mso-wrap-style:square'> <v:imagedata src="file:///C:\DOCUME~1\misickod\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image001.gif" mce_src="file:///C:\DOCUME~1\misickod\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image001.gif"   o:title="trans" /> </v:shape><![endif]--><!--[if !vml]--></span></p>

<p><strong>Doug: Now what provoked you to write <em><a href="http://pulltheplugonatheism.com/book_think.shtml">You Can Lead An Atheist to Evidence But You Can&#8217;t Make Him Think</a>?</em></strong></p>
<p>Ray: Well, God&#8217;s given us six senses, and the sixth sense is Common Sense. That&#8217;s the sense that atheists lack. I just want them to <em>think </em>a little. All you have to do is look around you to see the genius of God&#8217;s creative hand. That&#8217;s what the book brings out. Any atheist who <em>thinks</em> a little will change his world view very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>That brings us to the question of how can you convince an atheist that God exists?</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;re in a building, look around and say to yourself, how do I know there was a build<em>er? </em>It is axiomatic that a building can not create itself. It can not build itself. Nor can a painting paint itself. A painting is absolute proof that there is a painter. A building is absolute, 100% scientific proof that there is a builder. There is no better evidence that there is a builder than to have a building. The same applies to the existence of God. Creation is 100% scientific evidence that there is a Creator. You can not have a Creation without a Creator. My agenda really isn&#8217;t to convince an atheist that God exists. He already knows he exists. The Book of Romans tells us this: that &#8220;the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made, even as eternal power and godhead, so they are without excuse.&#8221; My aim is to convince the atheist that he needs God&#8217;s forgiveness, and to convince the person sitting on the fence that atheism isn&#8217;t intellectual, as some people think it is. It&#8217;s not scientific, as some people think it is. It&#8217;s more than foolish. In fact, the bible says that the atheist (and this is what we see today ) is not only a fool (Psalm 14 verse 1), but he&#8217;s a man who professes himself wise for becoming a fool. And that&#8217;s exactly what atheists and evolutionists do. They say, we don&#8217;t believe in God, and anybody who does is a knuckle-dragger who denies that science tells us the very opposite is the case.</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 14:1 says, &#8220;Fools say in their hearts there is no God. Their deeds are loathsome and corrupt and not one does what is right.&#8221; There&#8217;s another one in Deuteronomy: &#8220;If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife of your bosom, or the friend who is not of your soul entices you secretly saying, &#8216;let us go and serve other Gods&#8217;, you should not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him. But you shall kill him. Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people. You shall stone him to death with stones.&#8221; &#8211; Deuteronomy 13:6.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;What do you make of <em>that? </em></strong></p>
<p>Well, Israel had 613 precepts in the law. The law is broken up into three governments. There is the Civil Law, the Ceremonial Law&#8230; Civil, Ceremonial. There&#8217;s another&#8230; I can&#8217;t remember. Oh, the Moral Law. The Moral Law is the Ten Commandments which tells us right from wrong. Civil Law was instructions to Israel to carry out court cases. If somebody violated the law, they would be punished, and the laws were very, very harsh. Especially against idolatry. If Israel strayed into idolatry, God gave the death sentence. Ceremonial Law is the one evolutionists often grab and say, &#8216;look, the bible is so stupid. It says you shouldn&#8217;t eat lobster. It says you shouldn&#8217;t mix wool with cotton.&#8217; Well, we now know that wool mixed with cotton produces sweat within the human body and God said he didn&#8217;t want priests sweating when they came in to the temple. We know that the lobster eats off the bottom of the floor of the sea and it eats filthy stuff, and its meat isn&#8217;t exactly good. So, Ceremonial Law was just for the health of Israel. Civil Law was the court system that was put in place &#8211; and the Moral Law is the law that will judge humanity on the Day of Judgment. When you understand that, the bible begins to make a lot of sense.</p>
<p><strong>So we&#8217;re not talking about actually killing atheists?</strong></p>
<p>Of course not. We want to see them come alive. They&#8217;re dead in their trespasses and sins and we want them to come alive. I love atheists. I&#8217;ve had meals with them. A lot of atheists are my friends. So, no, I don&#8217;t want to kill atheists, I don&#8217;t want to kill homosexuals, I don&#8217;t want to kill people that disobey their parents. I want them to come to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>This seems like a bit of interpretational hocus-pocus. The Vatican has done essentially the same thing with evolution. They have said that The Creation doesn&#8217;t need to be interpreted exactly as such, that Darwinian theory can fit in. But you don&#8217;t see it like that. You spoke out vehemently against the <a href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/genesis-isnt-science-book-vatican-study-evolution-benedicts-trip-france-an">Catholic dictates of Gianfranco Ravasi, the Vatican&#8217;s Pontifical Counsel for Culture</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Because there is no way you can reconcile the Bible with evolution. What you have to do is create your own God. Because the God who revealed himself to Israel said that he made male and female, made man in his own image &#8211; and God is not a primate. And the scriptures also say that there is one kind of flesh of beast and one kind of flesh of man. There is no way you can reconcile the two. What you have to do is create a God in your own image and say, &#8216;Yep, the God that I believe in&#8217; &#8211; and this is what the Vatican says &#8211; says that they&#8217;re both reconcilable, that God created man as a primate that evolved into a human homo sapien. There is no way that the scriptures say that at all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Humans</em></strong><strong> are in the category of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate">primate</a>.</strong></p>
<p>No. I don&#8217;t think so. I think man is made in the image of God, and that he&#8217;s completely excepted from animals in that he&#8217;s got moral accountability. He has a conscience. He sets up court systems. No way do you get dogs, horses, cats, cattle, or primates setting up court systems that mete out justice on those that transgress the laws that I&#8217;ve stated. Only man does that, because man is unique in the creation of God, and I believe that that&#8217;s because he is made in the image of God. I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re apes as many people do. Some of my friends act like apes, but I don&#8217;t believe they are.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;Yeah&#8230; Sorry &#8211; <em>how</em> do we distinguish the different types of laws in the Books?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the Jews do. If you&#8217;ve studied Jewish history, and studied Jewish scriptures, you&#8217;ll see that they break up the 613 precepts into 3 parts: Moral, Ceremonial, and Civil&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So you have the atheist, and you show him &#8220;Creation&#8221; and you say that it is created. That&#8217;s dependent on using the word Creation which presupposes a creator. Now to take it from the reverse, how do you show an atheist something that wasn&#8217;t created to compare against?</strong></p>
<p>Can you name something that wasn&#8217;t created?</p>
<p><strong>Well, if everything was created, that doesn&#8217;t give us a standard to set anything by.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the question is, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>If one claims God created <em>everything</em>, then points at something itself as evidence that God created it doesn&#8217;t really stand up syllogistically as <a href="http:///">an argument.</a></strong></p>
<p>It does if you&#8217;ve got <em>Common Sense! </em>That&#8217;s all you need!<em> </em>Okay&#8230; If God didn&#8217;t create everything, <em>who created it?</em></p>
<p><strong>When the question is &#8220;who&#8221;, that presupposes that some<em>body </em>has planned it.</strong></p>
<p>If evolution created everything, is evolution intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>No. Evolution is &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Never mind creating a frog. Let me see. How would you start if you had to create a frog from nothing?? You&#8217;re saying evolution created everything from nothing, I&#8217;m saying God created everything from nothing. God is eternal, he&#8217;s without the dimension of time and he created all things from nothing.</p>
<p><strong>So naturally the question is, where then did God come from?</strong></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a good question. He had no beginning, he has no end, because he doesn&#8217;t dwell within the dimension of time. God created Time and subjected man to it, and because we dwell in the dimension of time, logic demands a beginning and an end. God&#8217;s eternal. If you don&#8217;t believe that, take the time to study Bible prophecy. Look at <a href="http:///">Matthew 24</a>, or <a href="http:///">Luke 21</a> and see how God can flick through history as you or I can flick through the pages of a history book. So, because God is eternal, because He dwells without the dimension of time, he fits the bill of creating the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Well, but <em>then, </em>if something was eternal, why not the material world?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the <a href="http:///">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a> called entropy. If you leave an apple on the table for two weeks, it rots. If you leave a rock for a billion years, it turns to dust. If the universe was eternal, it would have turned to dust. Entropy, the Second Law of Thermodynamics says there&#8217;s no way the universe could be eternal, and that&#8217;s an accepted scientific fact.</p>
<p><strong>Matter disperses in its concentrations, but &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Everything is subject to entropy. It rots.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Which means our present form may dissolve, but not that the matter from which it came will disappear.</strong></p>
<p>Then everything around us would be dust if it were eternal. But we don&#8217;t see that. We see flowers, birds, and trees, and fruits. And we see the genius of God&#8217;s creative hand. Look, let&#8217;s say I believed in evolution just for a moment. Let&#8217;s say there was a Big Bang. We won&#8217;t ask where the material came from for the Big Bang, but we&#8217;ll just believe that it happened. From there, after a billion years evolved the first dog. We see it evolved. Fully evolved. It&#8217;s got four legs, a wagging tail. It&#8217;s got a heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, and it&#8217;s got eyes. Over a billion years it couldn&#8217;t see, but now its eyes are fully evolved to a point in which it can see, and it needs to see, because it needs to find a female. It needs to find a female that evolved at the right place at the right time and the right reproductive organs with which it can mate. Because if he can&#8217;t find a female, he&#8217;s a dead dog. Then you&#8217;ve got to translate that same scenario over the giraffes, zebras, elephants, horses, cats, goats, fish, and birds. In fact there&#8217;s 1.4 million species, and every one of them had to have a female evolve at the right place at the right time with the right reproductive organs and a desire to mate, or they couldn&#8217;t keep the species going.</p>
<p>Which came first, the blood, the heart, or the blood vessels? If the heart came first, why did it evolve when there was no blood? If the blood came first, why did it evolve, and how did it get around without blood vessels? And if blood vessels came first, why did they evolve when there was no blood? The only way to reconcile this intellectually is to say to yourself, you know, man must have been created fully formed with fully functioning eyes, brain, lungs, heart, kidneys, blood, skin to hold it all in, alongside a female with the ability to reproduce after their own kind. There must have been dogs there with females, horses with females, to keep it all going.</p>
<p>When you think about evolution, it makes no sense at all. There&#8217;s no way it can be reconciled. I think it&#8217;s intellectually dishonest when we can&#8217;t create a grain of sand from nothing, to say this whole Creation just happened without an intelligent designer. I think it&#8217;s intellectually dishonest to say that.</p>
<p><strong>Simulations have been run &#8211; <a href="http:///">particularly at MSU</a> [Michigan State University] that allow basic components to follow Darwinian patterns, and what they show is that this can cause for very complex &#8220;creations&#8221;, and cellular biology covers this &#8211; but I must say, I don&#8217;t understand your <a href="http:///">female argument</a>. If you look at biology, and study cellular biology, back to the level of <a href="http:///">mitosis and meiosis</a>, males and females aren&#8217;t said to develop separately &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Then how did they get here? Why is it that every one of the 1.4 million species has a male and female, except for a few worms and things like that? Every single one of them! Giraffes, elephants, horses, male human beings have females. How did that happen? And how did they reproduce before there was male and female?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http:///">Male/Female reproduction</a> serves a survival benefit [genetic diversity], but this really isn&#8217;t a good forum to go into the deep biology of it &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Do you know why?? Because evolution doesn&#8217;t have an answer&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>It doesn&#8217;t need an answer on where the first male/female common ancestor first split under what circumstances. We can see that &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>I do! I need an answer! I want to find answers!</p>
<p><strong>Just because you need an answer doesn&#8217;t mean we have an answer, or that your answer is correct!</strong></p>
<p>No. But as &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>So is that <em>good enough??</em></strong></p>
<p>No. Being a skeptic, I want solid evidence. Faith is not enough. I&#8217;m not going to sit back and say I believe that Michigan State University did this, or that I believe million years ago, <em>this</em>. Evolution is based on a blind faith, and a pseudo science. I want facts. I used to believe evolution till I asked for facts, and I couldn&#8217;t find any.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re kidding me.</strong></p>
<p>No I&#8217;m <em>not</em> kidding you.</p>
<p><strong>Go to a bookstore. There are <a href="http:///">bookshelves full of books on evolution</a> that answer exactly the things you&#8217;re talking about.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to museums where I&#8217;ve been told there are millions of fossils. I went to the Grand Evolution Museum in Paris with a camera crew. I spent an hour with my crew looking for the evolution display and evidence. We had to ask somebody, and they took us to a stuffed monkey with &#8216;Lucy&#8217; written on it and Origin of Species in a glass case. That&#8217;s all they had, and that&#8217;s all they&#8217;ve got. They say that there are millions of fossils in the fossil record, and millions of bones, and there are! But they speak of Intelligent Design. They don&#8217;t speak of evolution. There&#8217;s no species to species transitional forms in the fossil record. There is none! And the Missing Link is still missing, despite what people may say.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s always missing links. As somebody said, once you fill in one spot with a missing link, you&#8217;ve opened two more gaps on either side of it. How do you explain <a href="http:///">Lucy</a>? Is Lucy not a &#8220;missing link&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>No! Of course not. It&#8217;s just like the other things. Paleontologists have a huge incentive to just exaggerate a little. Just move this &#8211; just call&#8230; If you can find a bone with a lump on it, and come up with a theory, and call it a big name, and say that it&#8217;s 73 million years old, you could get your face on National Geographic magazine. You could get a book deal. You could be set for life speaking about the discovery you made. I&#8217;m a skeptic. I want proof. I&#8217;m not just going to say, I believe. I want proof when it comes to something as important as evolution, because your eternity&#8217;s at stake. If you say there is no God, that evolution created everything, that everything came from nothing &#8211; well, then you&#8217;re going to live your life accordingly. You&#8217;re going to ignore the claims of the Gospel, you&#8217;re not going to repent of your sins and trust the saviour &#8211; so it&#8217;s a huge issue for Christians.</p>
<p><strong>It is for Christians. That&#8217;s <a href="http:///">Pascal&#8217;s Wager</a>. My problem with that is, it&#8217;s not between one and the other. It&#8217;s not between believing in God and having your proper eternity, or not believing in God. It&#8217;s between <a href="http:///"><em>a whole slew</em> of Gods</a>&#8230; or no Gods.</strong></p>
<p>Remember the First Commandment? &#8220;Thou Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me&#8221;. Of course there are other gods. They are images that man makes up. They are other gods that he feels comfortable with. I did it before I was a Christian. I didn&#8217;t shape a God with my hands, but I shaped a God with my mind, a God I felt comfortable with, a God I could snuggle up to, it was a non-existent God that was a figment of my imagination. You know, the atheists believe that everything came from nothing. And he&#8217;ll deny that through gritted teeth because it&#8217;s intellectually embarrassing. If you say, I have no belief that my Ford truck had a maker&#8230; that means you think it just happened.</p>
<p><strong>But if you have a God that came from nothing, you really haven&#8217;t resolved anything&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>No, no, no, no! NO! NO! God is eternal. He didn&#8217;t come from nothing.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s just magic-ing the question away.</strong></p>
<p>No, no. It&#8217;s not if it&#8217;s the truth. He has no beginning and no end. You know, space has no beginning and no end. If you say &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Then why isn&#8217;t Space the Grand Creator? &#8220;Space: The First Cause&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>Because God&#8217;s the Creator of Space. The Creator of the Universe. Space can&#8217;t create itself. A painting can not paint itself. There&#8217;s got to be a painter, there&#8217;s got to be a builder.</p>
<p><strong>And there&#8217;s that language game of calling it &#8220;Creation&#8221;. What if we call everything we can observe, feel, &#8220;The Natural World&#8221;? So it necessarily follows the laws of Physics, the &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a natural world, there&#8217;s a supernatural creator&#8230;</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>&#8230;See. You see order wherever you look, from the atom to the Universe, there&#8217;s order. If you look down the beach and you saw that someone had written in the sand, &#8220;Tommy, be home at 2 o&#8217;clock for dinner&#8221;, you&#8217;ve got to say an intelligent mind created it. DNA is a language! It tells us that there&#8217;s a designer! The more man&#8217;s knowledge grows, the more he should be in awe of what God&#8217;s done with his Creation. Look at the flowers, the birds, the trees. The seasons come round every year. Grab a peach, or an orange, or an apple. All these things tell us there&#8217;s an intelligent mind. Everything we eat comes from the soil. I mean, what kind of miracle is that?? Everything we eat comes from the soil! It yields, just like the Bible says, &#8220;food for man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do you think you&#8217;re a <em>good person???</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;Hmm. More or less&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Let me ask you something. This will convince you more than anything else of what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>
<p>How many lies have you told in your life?</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s hard to quantify&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>50? 100? 200? Lost count?</p>
<p><strong>Hmmmm&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hard question. So &#8211; what do you call somebody who tells lies?</p>
<p><strong>It depends. They could be a survivalist depending on the situation, or they could &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about people who tell lies. It rhymes with fire, begins with L.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. &#8220;Liar&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever stolen anything in your life, even if small?</p>
<p><strong>Yup.</strong></p>
<p>What do you call somebody who steals things?</p>
<p><strong>Thief.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever taken the Lord&#8217;s name in vain?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s called blasphemy, using God&#8217;s name is a cuss word. And Jesus said that if you look at a woman and lust for her, you&#8217;ve already committed adultery in your heart.</p>
<p><strong>Then why not have sex with her too?</strong></p>
<p>Well, you do what you might. So here&#8217;s a summation of your moral state, by your own admission: you&#8217;re a lying thief, a blasphemer and an adulterer at heart. And that&#8217;s only four of the 10 commandments!</p>
<p><strong>Oh, come on! Are you going to tell me you&#8217;re not too?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve broken all those commandments, probably more than you. That&#8217;s why I need a saviour. That&#8217;s why I need somebody to wash away my sins. So I can stand before holy God on the Day of Judgment and not be condemned to Hell. That&#8217;s why Christ died. So your sins could be washed away. Mine were washed away 36 years ago. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can live like a hypocrite, but it means that I&#8217;ve got ever-lasting life, and that&#8217;s what I want to share with other people. So the issue really isn&#8217;t an intellectual issue, it&#8217;s a moral issue. Christianity throws a wet, heavy blanket on a sinful lifestyle. And to change that whole world-view in an instant, somebody can dismiss the whole moral issue by saying, I don&#8217;t believe in God, I believe in evolution, I&#8217;m not morally responsible to God. I am an animal. These sexual prowlings I have are just me trying to keep my species going &#8211; and that&#8217;s really the issue.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t think that non-believers are generally so to give themselves moral license.</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t say that, because there may be some that are.</p>
<p><strong>There may be some that are, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the grand underlying reason for atheism. If our morals come from God, and this is something we feel instinctively, we&#8217;re programmed from God&#8217;s Word to feel, then how could there be conflicting moral codes?</strong></p>
<p>How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>How is it that I&#8217;d have a different set of morals from anybody else? We&#8217;re all getting it from the same source.</strong></p>
<p>We all have our free choice as human beings. We&#8217;re not robots. And if I want to steal, I can steal. If I want to rape, I can rape. If I want to lust, I can lust. You can consider stealing to be okay. You can say, my boss is rich, it&#8217;s not really stealing. We tend to do this as human beings, but that doesn&#8217;t make any difference. God is a moral absolute, and stealing&#8217;s wrong, and we have a conscience to tell us it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>This is still talking about giving yourself license to do something that&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221;. I&#8217;m talking about having a set of morals that isn&#8217;t biblical, nor self-serving. For example, I saw on your website that you had <a href="http:///">attributed the drought and wild-fires in California to homosexual marriage</a><a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2008/06/atheist-worldview.html"> </a>&#8211;</strong></p>
<p>No! That&#8217;s not my website. I wouldn&#8217;t say that! <sup><a href="#footnote_0_353" id="identifier_0_353" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="You be the judge.&nbsp; On his site, Ray received this comment: &ldquo;There&rsquo;ve been several hundred gay marriages enacted in California  in the past few days. Maybe a couple of thousand by now, I haven&rsquo;t checked the  numbers. And in the non-gay-marrying Midwest, they&rsquo;re fighting floods, while in  California it&rsquo;s fair and dry. How is The Golden State managing to escape the  wrath of your imaginary friend, I wonder?&rdquo; It was attributed to the name of &ldquo;Weemaryanne&rdquo;.&nbsp; Ray&rsquo;s response was as follows: &ldquo;Maryanne. At present there are 840 wild-fires that are burning at once in  California, destroying many homes. The fires were started by lightning strikes.  Guess who&rsquo;s in charge of the electrical department? These are from thunder  storms that have no rain. Guess who gives the rain? You said &ldquo;while in  California it&rsquo;s fair and dry.&rdquo; We are having the worst drought in our  recorded history. Last year 1,155 homes were destroyed. You live in an  imaginary world. I suggest you get out more.&rdquo; http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2008/06/atheist-worldview.html">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Atheist Central?</strong></p>
<p>No. That would be a homo&#8211; an atheist saying I&#8217;d said that. I&#8217;d never say that.</p>
<p><strong>Is Atheist Central yours???</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, but it&#8217;s not me saying it. You probably read a comment from an atheist saying, &#8216;you say that&#8230;&#8217; No, I&#8217;d never say that.</p>
<p><strong>So you <em>wouldn&#8217;t </em>say that God would lay wrath upon us for homosexual marriage?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that when we have a nation that has tornados and hurricanes, droughts, fires, and cancer that&#8217;s just consuming the nation &#8211; these are not a sign of God&#8217;s blessings. The Bible says, righteousness exalts nations. If we&#8217;re a country that does right and does good, God says he&#8217;ll give us good weather, and good crops, and bless the fruit of the womb. So what we&#8217;re seeing in the United States at the moment is not God&#8217;s Hand of Blessing, but I never said that God&#8217;s wrath will come upon the nation for homosexuality. But I&#8217;m not saying homosexuality&#8217;s right, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>But, if I understand correctly, you&#8217;d also be entirely opposed to gay marriage &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; And bestiality, and adultery, and rape. Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>See. That&#8217;s just a point we disagree on. But I&#8217;m not giving myself license to do anything here, and yet I feel that homosexuals should have the same rights as anybody else &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>What about paedophiles?</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s similar.</strong></p>
<p>No. But I&#8217;m asking you a question&#8230; Why not paedophiles? Why can&#8217;t they have the same rights as anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re talking consensual. We&#8217;re talking about adults, and when we say adults &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>A consensual kid, a 10 year old who wants to have sex and play around with a man who&#8217;s, you know, 43? What&#8217;s wrong with that??</p>
<p><strong>We don&#8217;t consider them old enough to make that decision yet.</strong></p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s consensual, and the kid says, I&#8217;m old enough, I know what I&#8217;m doing?</p>
<p><strong>What you&#8217;re saying &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve got is &#8211; if you start making up your own moral code, what are you basing it on? You know &#8211; child pornography. Is that okay? The kid doesn&#8217;t know about it. You know, they film the kids when they&#8217;re naked, and there&#8217;s a hidden camera. They sell the photos. What&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>I still don&#8217;t understand how this relates &#8211; ?</strong></p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that if you start saying that something is right by what I feel, society says it&#8217;s okay, where&#8217;s it going to stop?</p>
<p><strong>But if what I <em>feel </em>comes from God to begin with, and I&#8217;m not giving myself license through my own moral code, where does that come from, if not from &#8220;God&#8221;. Clearly there&#8217;s a separate moral source.</strong></p>
<p>It comes from your feelings, and you can&#8217;t trust your feelings. That&#8217;s why God gave us the Bible. The Bible puts in black &amp; white God&#8217;s will. And you can read his will. It&#8217;s the New Testament. It&#8217;s the will of God. It&#8217;s what God wants, and he says thieves, adulterers, fornicators, homosexuals, etc. will not inherit the Kingdom of God, so what I feel doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. So we don&#8217;t feel the morals that &#8220;God&#8221; instilled in us? It&#8217;s all just text.</strong></p>
<p>No! You&#8217;ve got a conscience, and if you listen to your conscience &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Exactly! That&#8217;s what I mean. How can my conscience contradict &#8220;God&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p>The bible says, sear your conscience. Have you ever taken a steak and thrown it on a hot plate, and you actually kill the outside of the steak and make it hard, but on the inside it is tender. That&#8217;s called &#8220;searing&#8221; a steak. You can sear your conscience. You can actually harden it. So, the first time you look at pornography, you think, oh I feel guilty. Second time, not so guilty. Fifteenth time, your conscience doesn&#8217;t even speak to you. What you&#8217;ve done is sear your conscience. So a conscience isn&#8217;t reliable. That&#8217;s why you need the bible. It tells you in black &amp; white what God says is right and what God says is wrong. That make sense???</p>
<p><strong>If you didn&#8217;t have the Bible, would you act immorally?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We all act immorally, whether with the Bible or not.</p>
<p><strong>But you wouldn&#8217;t rape or murder or whatever else if you didn&#8217;t have the Bible to tell you not to.</strong></p>
<p>Well, why were there 200,000 people murdered in the United States between the years of 1990 and the year 2000? In a 10 year period, 200,000 Americans &#8211; murdered! People still murder. We do wrong, because we have a propensity to do evil. We lie and steal and lust and commit adultery and fornicate, because we love to sin &#8211; and when you become a Christian, God changes your heart, so you love that which is right and hate that which is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>What of Christians who commit murder?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s called hypocrisy. Christians that commit adultery and murder, and lie and steal &#8211; that&#8217;s hypocrisy. Hypocrite means &#8220;pretender&#8221;. If you&#8217;re not fooled by a hypocrite, how much less is God? So, don&#8217;t worry about hypocrites, they&#8217;ll answer to God on Judgment Day.</p>
<p><strong>Well&#8230; okay. I just have to get back to the female question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>(Laughs) Don&#8217;t all men feel like that?</p>
<p><strong>This idea that&#8230; (sighs)&#8230; I just hope you can elaborate this more. The idea that females kind of developed &#8212; I&#8217;m actually not sure how you picture this. I&#8217;m really not sure what your concept is on the biology of male/female division.</strong></p>
<p>Well, everywhere I see, I see male and female: giraffes, elephants, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, fish, birds. Everywhere! You ask the evolutionists how this happened. They&#8217;ve got no answer&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>But they <em>do.</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, then tell me simply, what happened? Where did the female come from and how did it happen to 1.4 million species without an intelligent mind?</p>
<p><strong>Okay. This goes to Cellular Biology, and they have a common ancestor, all males and females, and they&#8217;re not left in separate locations at separate times to find one another! We&#8217;re talking about a method of reproduction &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>How could they reproduce without a female? They can&#8217;t just split in two.</p>
<p><strong>Cells can &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>When did the dog start doing the female thing? When did she come along? And the elephant, and the giraffe, and the horse, and male and female homo sapiens? It becomes a huge nightmare when you start thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>No. You see, we have a common ancestor at the cellular level <em>and beyond. </em>And this does take a good deal of explanation, but my challenge to you then is if I can show you clippings from five textbooks that explain this process &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>From billions of years ago. And then I have to believe this, because the professor tells me.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to believe this, but you have to admit that you&#8217;re misrepresenting Biology.</strong></p>
<p>No I&#8217;m not. Not scientific Biology. There&#8217;s a pseudoscience. A lot of these scientists should have got jobs as Disney imagineers, because their beliefs are based on imaginations of men. That&#8217;s my opinion. And I&#8217;m allowed my opinion because this is America. I don&#8217;t have to be shaped in a mould and believe the theory of evolution. And I don&#8217;t believe Evolution, even though I did once. So what we&#8217;re going to have to do is agree to differ, but that&#8217;s healthy, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><strong>It is healthy. But I do have a problem in that you <a href="http:///">associate yourself with people like Pat Robertson</a> &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>No I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>You do his programme!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing an interview with you!! It doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m married to you! Wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m associated with you.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but Robertson&#8217;s more low-brow.</strong></p>
<p>More what?</p>
<p><strong>Low-brow.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&#8217;s your opinion. I think he&#8217;s a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a guy who, with Falwell &#8211; who was a plainly odious character &#8211; <a href="http:///">claimed that 9/11 was some kind of vengeance</a> for &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Well, I would never say that.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m glad to know that.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awful thing. Think of the relatives hearing that.</p>
<p><strong>Exactly. I agree. And my problem with people&#8217;s beliefs imposing on public policy is-</strong></p>
<p>Well, remember, it&#8217;s people&#8217;s opinions, and this is America, and that&#8217;s allowed. It&#8217;s not people&#8217;s beliefs being imposed upon people. I&#8217;m not imposing my opinion on you. I&#8217;ve got my belief, you&#8217;ve got yours, and that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p><strong>What of these &#8220;bad atheists&#8221; [you write about] who are trying to &#8220;take away the rights of Christians&#8221;? I don&#8217;t see that&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s the rights of Americans. We have a Freedom of Religion in this country like no other nation. We can be a Hindu, a Muslim, a Buddhist, Christian, Jew, Gentile. That&#8217;s been purchased by the blood of our soldiers. We&#8217;ve got a wonderful freedom in this country. What certain atheists have got an agenda to do is &#8211; not to push their beliefs or opinions &#8211; they legally are taking away these rights of freedom of worship in this country, and I&#8217;m going to fight it.</p>
<p><strong>How are they doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Suing the Gideons for giving bibles out in schools.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s just Separation of Church and State. They can distribute propaganda anywhere else.</strong></p>
<p>They can give bibles out in schools. This is America. Come on! The Bible&#8217;s a wonderful History book.</p>
<p><strong>Not at a State-sponsored school.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s Freedom of Literature. Why not give a bible out in schools? It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s greatest seller. Let them become educated. Let them make up their own minds. Let&#8217;s teach Evolution and Creationism. What&#8217;s wrong with that? Why censor Intelligent Design?</p>
<p><strong>Because it has no basis in Science.</strong></p>
<p>It is Science.</p>
<p><strong>How is it Science?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s The TRUTH! And you&#8217;re censoring Science.</p>
<p><strong>I would have to direct you to the judge&#8217;s <a href="http:///">ruling in the Dover trial</a> and tell you that it [Intelligent Design] is not Science. Evolution has a vast body of research supporting it. Somebody like Richard Dawkins, or PZ Meyers &#8211; even though I know <a href="http:///">he adjudged you a moron</a> &#8211; to call them &#8220;unintelligent&#8221; &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they&#8217;re both very silly men. Dawkins thinks that we came from aliens, and that aliens created everything. And PZ Meyers is in that same category, so I don&#8217;t see these as being intelligent, as you do. I see them as having great, great faith &#8211; blind faith amidst the genius of God&#8217;s Creation.</p>
<p>And you know what? I have a beautiful wife who&#8217;s just come home. I leave for Florida tonight on a plane. I just got back from New Zealand three days ago after being seven days here, so I really want to have dinner with her, so can we wrap this up?</p>
<p><strong>Sure.</strong></p>
<p>She&#8217;s a beautiful wife. Made for Comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Very good. Thank you very much for talking to me&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been really good talking to you, Doug&#8230;</p>

<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_353" class="footnote">You be the judge.  On his site, Ray received this comment: &#8220;There&#8217;ve been several hundred gay marriages enacted in California  in the past few days. Maybe a couple of thousand by now, I haven&#8217;t checked the  numbers. And in the non-gay-marrying Midwest, they&#8217;re fighting floods, while in  California it&#8217;s fair and dry. How is The Golden State managing to escape the  wrath of your imaginary friend, I wonder?&#8221; It was attributed to the name of &#8220;Weemaryanne&#8221;.  Ray&#8217;s response was as follows: &#8220;Maryanne. At present there are 840 wild-fires that are burning at once in  California, destroying many homes. The fires were started by lightning strikes.  Guess who’s in charge of the electrical department? These are from thunder  storms that have no rain. Guess who gives the rain? You said &#8220;while in  California it&#8217;s fair and dry.&#8221; We are having <em>the worst drought in our  recorded history</em>. Last year 1,155 homes were destroyed. You live in an  imaginary world.

            <div class='commenttext'><p>He has a certain charm doesn&#8217;t he? He reads like he is constantly interrupting, getting his point across, or making sure that the Bible gets sold.<br />
How about a discussion about the book that was verbally propagated for many years, is missing stories (the apocrypha &#8211; decided by men that the stories were unsuitable for the masses), and they even got the hero&#8217;s name wrong in the 2nd half &#8211; he was called Joshua.</p>
<p>Imagineers. Love &#8217;em. even the ones that use common sense&#8230;and what is common sense? It presupposes much, and is a great pitch to keep selling those books. Almost turning the discourse between the atheist and the christian into a class war.</p>

            <div class='commenttext'><p>Comfort tortures himself through faith and doctrines not even proved to be valid; straying from instinct and applying himself less to the benefits of others, as it seems. To bring up another point, by saying that the taste of a banana is pleasing to the taste buds is too generalized a statement, as not everyone enjoys the taste of the fruit, and as some are even allergic to it. Another example of ignorance perpetuated by fear.</p>
