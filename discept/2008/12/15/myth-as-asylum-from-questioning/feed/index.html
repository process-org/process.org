					<description><![CDATA[Was Crowley&#039;s &quot;Equinox&quot; all  about being a journal of &quot;scientific illumination?&quot;
An attempt to reconcile so called opposites? Do I need to remind every Catholic
of the Inquisition? No, but it is one of my favorite songs!

Anton La Vey said &quot;the grey area&quot;  between Religion and Psychology needed a
bridge. As someone who is from a religious background I can testify by observation of my groups  and by watching other groups of religions that 
Masochism plays a big role in most religions. Madonna watching her mum dance around with her knees on beans in the kitchen floor made quite an impression? 
 I tell myself personally, in dark moments  &quot;they&#039;re all going to laugh at you&quot; 

I like Religion, other than Plutonium and a handful of other devices, it really is what a person does with it.

My own mish- mash of Christian , Buddhist and &quot;Satanic&quot;  symbols
have served me well. I like believing that staring at pictures of people I like
will give them good vibes. 

Dear God, please save me from all your people?  Sure.

The best way in life is to be kind and treat others like you want to be treated.
How much you respond to being mistreated is up to you. In my philosophy.
I have noticed that &quot;karma&quot; type effect from ones own bad behavior.


Maybe people don&#039;t want to get rid of religion as much as it&#039;s bad side effects.
People even worship the Earth. Persons with no faith usually just turn their
favorite philosophers into their god&#039;s or idols.

Our current state of affairs would seem to result from the worship of Money and Power, here on Earth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Timely article in The New Republic decrying continued attempts to reconcile religion &#038; science. The author&#039;s thoughts on &quot;liberal theologians&quot; were useful to me in considering the impact of being exposed to much liberal religiosity during my &#039;formative&#039; years. Perhaps I underestimate its dulling impact, as well as the possibility that a majority of American religious fall closer to the &quot;Baby Jesus Made The Earth 10,000 years ago&quot; end of the continuum than to that of the &quot;Praise Sagan&quot;.

&lt;i&gt;The reason that many liberal theologians see religion and evolution as harmonious is that they espouse a theology not only alien but unrecognizable as religion to most Americans.&lt;/i&gt;

http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=1e3851a3-bdf7-438a-ac2a-a5e381a70472

Excerpt

&lt;i&gt;So the most important conflict &lt;/i&gt;[snip&lt;i&gt;] is not between religion and science. It is between religion and secular reason. Secular reason includes science, but also embraces moral and political philosophy, mathematics, logic, history, journalism, and social science--every area that requires us to have good reasons for what we believe. Now I am not claiming that all faith is incompatible with science and secular reason--only those faiths whose claims about the nature of the universe flatly contradict scientific observations. Pantheism and some forms of Buddhism seem to pass the test. But the vast majority of the faithful--those 90 percent of Americans who believe in a personal God, most Muslims, Jews, and Hindus, and adherents to hundreds of other faiths--fall into the &quot;incompatible&quot; category.

Unfortunately, some theologians with a deistic bent seem to think that they speak for all the faithful. These were the critics who denounced Dawkins and his colleagues for not grappling with every subtle theological argument for the existence of God, for not steeping themselves in the complex history of theology. Dawkins in particular was attacked for writing The God Delusion as a &quot;middlebrow&quot; book. But that misses the point. He did indeed produce a middlebrow book, but precisely because he was discussing religion as it is lived and practiced by real people. The reason that many liberal theologians see religion and evolution as harmonious is that they espouse a theology not only alien but unrecognizable as religion to most Americans.

Statistics support this incompatibility. For example, among those thirty-four countries surveyed, we see a statistically strong negative relationship between the degree of faith and the acceptance of evolution. Countries such as Denmark, France, Japan and the United Kingdom have a high acceptance of Darwinism and low belief in God, while the situation is reversed in countries like Bulgaria, Latvia, Turkey, and the United States. And within America, scientists as a group are considerably less religious than non-scientists. This is not say that such statistics can determine the outcome of a philosophical debate. Nor does it matter whether these statistics mean that accepting science erodes religious faith, or that having faith erodes acceptance of science. (Both processes must surely occur.) What they do show, though, is that people have trouble accepting both at the same time. And given the substance of these respective worldviews, this is no surprise.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems clear that religious belief has a dulling effect on the drive for scientific discovery. It is an interesting mental exercise to imagine how mental processes involving religious experiences, and explanations for phenomena might change were it somehow possible to eradicate religiosity.

					<description><![CDATA[The likelihood of eradicating religious belief seems to be basically zero (certainly to my chagrin), though I do think it would behoove the ability for research and inquiry were it to occur. While i do accept that there are religious adherents who have intertwined facets of scientific discovery with their mythology (like the example you have provided), i suspect-cum-worry about the personality type of that religious adherent.

It seems not unlikely that a greater questioning of &#039;why things are the way they are in the universe&#039; is dulled by having a fallback-mythology; similarly, should push come to shove in the search to answer actual instances of those sorts of questions, a person who has an alternate solution in which they actually &#039;believe&#039; is likely to be less-than-tenacious in their pursuit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m hardly a religious apologist (though certainly a realist), and adding your voice to the alarm among the rationally minded seems sound enough. Still, I&#039;ve struggled to pinpoint my disagreement with much of your article. 

Sure, on the more alarming end of the spectrum, accepting &quot;religious-based explanations for real world phenomena&quot; has, it would seem, impinged on the collective intelligence of humanity (I&#039;d go into how I think this has occurred, but I think you already did nicely), not to mention the concerns you raised about public policy.

However, many religious adherents see no conflict between scientific discovery/knowledge and religious faith (e.g., the theory of evolution does not contradict the story of creation because of the metaphorical nature of the Bible). Perhaps more instructive than the pie chart of adherents you provided would be a percentage of those adherents whose religious beliefs do not contradict or belie scientific inquiry and critical thought. My guess is that this manner of approaching faith and reason is more common than the tone of your article would suggest. 

I think the crux of my difficulty in sorting out my patently experienced disagreement with much of what you&#039;ve written here is this: It seems to imply that eradicating religious belief is not only a good idea, but one that is possible. Am I mistaken? If not, what would you suggest be done with the reality of it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hadn&#039;t been on in ages, and you had me at hello!
I was raised in a strict Christian home, the sort that awaits &quot;the End&quot;---
whilst doing nothing in particular to save the world. A certain &quot;bring it on&quot;
mentality was in the air.
The world never DID end, but I always wait for it TO end.
Organized religion robbed me of ever enjoying being alive.
Instead of finding the ways of life, I found the ways of death.
Everyone at school was going to Hell, nothing was to be enjoyed.
Somehow Jesus wasn&#039;t able to deal with the emotional problems I was
demonstrating, so I was sent to psychiatry.
By my teenage years I was a self-styled satanist.
At my Christian school the teachers would ask me about the books I was reading
 I can&#039;t remember what the particular ones were, 
I guess the exposing of vast underground satanic networks
In a very real way the philosophy of Charles Manson is very accurate in
 discribing the reverse order in which the World operates.
I have no doubt Charlie has emotional problems not completely caused
by his 23 hours or more in isolation each day. 
Perhaps it&#039;s the &quot;gladiator style&quot; fighting matches held in his prison making
his so jumpy?
Anyway, I thought your blog nicely exposed the Starbucks style of religion
the church has disolved into.
The Church is now the friend of the world and the enemy of the people.
By that I mean to directly imply that it serves the needs of $commerce$
and &quot;tummy rubbing&quot; that the fearful need...
while any serious debate of science or politics is quickly silenced.
It&#039;s no wonder that it preaches against it&#039;s own greatest fears and passions.
The Satan Realm so badly lusted for and sought by 
Christians and Radical Islam and yes, the Jews and whatever other
&quot;trickle down&quot; faiths are out knocking, can be found within it&#039;s own
hallowed halls.
Those hallowed halls of inquistion and whitewash.
Drunk on the blood of saints and sinners.
Seeking to exalt itself above God, man and any law, supernatural or
otherwise.
Hard to support child molestors, drug dealers and murderers.
It would be forgivable if only they saw themselves for what they are.
I think it is sad they take no pleasure in the minds they rape.
I would feel much more chipper if I knew they secretly took joy
in their pointless rituals and kneeling and bowing and chanting
and condemning.
It&#039;s the dutyful wife come to suck.
The under paid servant come to clean.
The hand of death, out streached in compassion with a gun behind it&#039;s back.
Surprising, I never lost my faith in a higher power.
I pray he destroys these impostors in my witness, in my lifetime.
May the people of earth witness a day free from usury, fear and war.
A day free of Wolves in Sheep&#039;s clothing,
ever ready to pull the plug and push the button...
may they have the plug pulled on their own sinking ship.
If anyone can find the button, push it.
Dr. Kissinger will eventually push it anyway.
What will rise from the ashes?]]></description>
