								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As revelations of a major Mental Health Care scandal come to light, a malpractice settlement threatens to conceal the issue from scrutiny once more.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/money-talks-Edited.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1032" alt="money talks - Edited" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/money-talks-Edited-259x300.jpg" width="259" height="300" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/money-talks-Edited-259x300.jpg 259w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/money-talks-Edited.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /></a>On November 21, 2011, the first of four disturbingly similar malpractice lawsuits was filed against Castlewood Treatment Center, LLC. Among the allegations, a former client of the St. Louis based eating disorders clinic, Lisa Nasseff, claimed that “under the influence of various medically prescribed psychotropic medications” she was “negligently hypnotized” and coerced into believing that, among other things, she “was a member of a satanic cult and that she was involved in or perpetrated various criminal and horrific acts of abuse.” Leslie Thompson, Brooke Taylor, and Colette Travers all followed suit, each also alleging the cultivation of traumatic delusions while undergoing treatment at Castlewood, particularly under the care and supervision of one Mark Schwartz and his (then) wife Lori Galperin. The stage was set for an intense legal battle when, according to KMOV 4 in St. Louis, “Castlewood denied implanting false memories in the women and called the allegations bizarre.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the allegations <em>are</em> bizarre, but not <em>atypical</em> in the world of conspiracy theory-driven psychotherapy surrounding the mythic diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder [MPD] (now rebranded as Dissociative Identity Disorder [DID] in the American Psychiatric Association’s [APA] Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual [DSM]). Though lacking in empirical support, and despite indications to the contrary, the persistent theory maintains that certain conditions of psychological malaise are evidence of past trauma, even (in fact, especially) when the client has no conscious memory of those painful presumed events. Compartmentalized in “repressed” segments of the mind, these traumas are said to develop into isolate “personalities” independent of the client’s core self. Only by bringing the traumatic memories to full conscious assimilation can the client then be rid of the manifestations of distress these subconscious recollections provoke.<span id="more-1031"></span></p>
<p>This theory of “traumatic repression” therapy is a well-worn fictional plot device, similar to the slapstick theory that the only cure for head injury-induced amnesia is another good whack to the head… and just as dangerously ill-advised. Less generally known is the fact that such “therapy” is only distinguishable from mystical past-life regression sessions in narrative content, and identical “memory” retrieval tactics have provided the “evidentiary” basis for alien abduction claims. In fact it is well recognized, outside of the insular subculture of MPD/DID, that “recovered memories” are almost entirely worthless insofar as historical veracity is concerned. More often than recalling actual real-life events, clients subjected to Recovered Memory Therapies tend to confabulate false narratives that bear a striking resemblance to the presuppositions of trauma held by the therapist.</p>
<p>Despite their professional veneer, organizations like the International Society for the Study of Trauma &amp; Dissociation (ISSTD) &#8212; The primary proponents of DID theory today &#8212; still have no reliable method for discerning accurate recovered memory recall (if such a thing exists at all) from false memories created in therapy (a phenomenon that certainly exists). And while evidence continually amasses that such therapy is harmful and serves to instill clients with deeply-held delusions, the ISSTD still lacks in empirical support for “traumatic repression”. Worse, the organization abounds with conspiracy theorists still apparently invested in a paranoid delusion of secretive Satanic cult abuse. Just last year, at the ISSTD’s annual conference, they hosted a lecture by two deranged witch-hunters, Ellen Lacter &#8211;whose website contains helpful information about demonic possession as well as ludicrous advice, such as, “Pray a perimeter of protection against everything of witchcraft.” &#8212; and Valerie Sinason, a mocked British therapist famous for scenting Satan’s evil designs behind almost everything she comments upon. This year’s ISSTD conference will feature a lecture on advanced hypnosis by Richard Kluft, a panic-monger who dismissed the FBI’s Lanning Report &#8212; the result of investigation into once-prevalent claims of a Satanic cult conspiracy &#8212; as a “bullshit cover-up” for its conclusion that the “conspiracy” was but a delusional creation of a moral panic… a moral panic that Kluft himself played no small role in instigating.</p>
<p>As a journalist documenting the continued problem of Recovered Memory Therapies I have collected literally hundreds of hours of interviews with people oppressed by false memories cultivated in irresponsible and unscientific treatment. I have spoken at length with heart-broken families torn apart by false &#8212; sometimes even impossible &#8212; allegations of revealed past abuse. I have documented individuals who came to recognize that their “recovered memories” were indeed false memories, as well as individuals who hold to bizarre and implausible beliefs revealed in the course of treatment. New cases come to my attention with distressing regularity, though this problem continually escapes general recognition. The problem has persisted due to both the spinelessness of the APA and relevant licensing oversight boards, as well as a legal climate that allows for, essentially, cover-up. Countless cases of malpractice have been filed only to find the plaintiffs paid a large settlement out-of-court, bound to an agreement that they will never disclose the facts of their case to the public-at-large. The accused therapist often leaves the institution where the offense occurred, or is silently removed from staff, free to move relatively untarnished to another facility where the same practice is taken up.</p>
<p>With the minor media sensation that surrounded the initial filing of claims against Castlewood, many hoped that the issue would finally see the main-stream light of day, making its way to a full trial. Disappointingly, I received news last night from a reliable source that it appears all four Castlewood litigants appear ready to settle for a hefty sum, with gag orders, “within the month”. I certainly hope this does not come to pass, and with that in mind, I address the below to plaintiffs Lisa Nasseff, Leslie Thompson, Brooke Taylor, and Colette Travers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>What you should consider before accepting a buy-off with a gag-order attached</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>They are buying your silence.</strong> But they can’t ensure the silence of anybody else. Your gag orders will not only ensure that you refrain from criticizing or exposing your treatment at Castlewood under the care of Mark Schwartz and Lori Galperin, but it will ensure that you can’t speak in your own defense on the matter. The Castlewood case has become one of great interest to those concerned with the ongoing “recovered memory” controversy. You will silently watch &#8212; legally gagged &#8212; as the tale is revised, selectively redacted, and turned toward your own personal slander. The DID faithful, as is typical in their self-serving exercises in Cognitive Dissonance, will feel vindicated in their speculation that you all are merely opportunists who conspired to collect a massive payoff. The fact that you accepted payoff will be construed a evidence in and of itself that money was the only real motivating factor behind your lawsuits to begin with. Schwartz and Galperin, Recovered Memory Therapy advocates will happily point out, were not found guilty of anything at all. Once the papers are signed and the payoffs are distributed, this whole episode &#8212; despite the happy tale you are surely currently being sold by self-interested lawyers &#8212; will not go away. It will haunt your names constantly, and you’ll be powerless to ever set the record straight, to let your own cases be fully known.</p>
<p><strong>They are making you complicit.</strong> When the same outrages are committed against more Mental Health consumers &#8212; as they inevitably will be so long as delusion-harboring organizations like the ISSTD are allowed to offer continuing education credits for conspiracy theory-based seminars &#8212; you’ll be powerless to lend your voices in support. Further, you’ll know that you might have prevented their suffering if you had not failed to force Schwartz and Galperin face the allegations against them. You’ll know that you might have helped bring reform to a broken system had you persisted in seeking Justice… rather than accepting a payoff for silence.</p>
<p>Both Mark Schwartz and Lori Galperin have comfortably relocated to Malibu &#8212; Avalon Malibu Treatment Center &#8212; where nothing is preventing them from returning to the exact same “therapeutic” techniques they employed at Castlewood. Avalon Malibu Treatment Center (headed by CEO Jeff Schwartz, alleged to be Mark Schwartz’s own brother) seems entirely unconcerned about, and dismissive of, any questions or requests for assurances that the events alleged to have occurred at Castlewood will be safeguarded against in their own facility. They have entirely ignored the inquiries of at least two journalists (including myself). If you fail to seek Justice, Schwartz is free to continue the exact type of therapy you allege to have caused you such horrific distress. Make no mistake, in taking a settlement you enable this.</p>
<p><strong>You are denying justice to those who are unable to seek reparation through litigation.</strong> Since the beginning of the Castlewood case, I have personally spoken with families who claim to have lost their daughters to delusions instilled in them during the course of Mark Schwartz’s “therapy”. During treatment at Castlewood, it is alleged, these girls “learned”, through “recovered memories”, that they were abused as children, and that their parents were either the direct perpetrators, or complicit in, the crimes against them. The allegations are identical to the claims you have brought against Castlewood. Unlike yourselves, however, these girls have held fast to their false memories, even in the face of disconfirming evidence. The shattered remains of their unjustly accused families find themselves unable to sue for malpractice, not being direct recipients of the therapeutic maltreatment themselves. They look to you to see that Mark Schwartz and Lori Galperin face Justice. They are left, again, with less than nothing if you agree to settle.</p>
<p><strong>Your lawyers aren’t necessarily your friends, and they could probably do better.</strong> They may be perfectly happy to take the money and run, and their consciences aren’t likely to be distressed when the same crimes are perpetrated against new potential legal clients. The arrangement of a settlement-with-gag-order strikes me as, in all likelihood, the most convenient path of least resistance for them. Divorced from any sense of Justice, this is simply a business transaction in the legal world. Don’t let the lawyers convince you that this is the only way. Just today, I was in contact with a former recovered memory therapy victim past ISSTD president Bennett Braun. She wrote to me that, “with excellent attorneys, I took a quite generous settlement agreement containing no gag order.” and she emphasized that she would “definitely advise” against a gag order. I know many others who aren’t as lucky, and it is to their eternal regret that they ever collected a settlement and accepted a gag-order before justice was served. They are left to watch the careers of those who victimized them carry forward untarnished, continuing to practice and promote harmful therapies.</p>
<p>Are you truly resigned to a life of the same?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spend a chunk of each year directing a traveling food adventure show for The Food Network, Discovery Asia and Food TV UK. The really fantastic thing about the job is not only the travel, but also that I work with local people for a solid week in each location. It provides a window on different ways of life in a really accelerated way.  At the end of 2009 I shot an episode in New Iberia Louisiana. This episode was about the New Iberia Gumbo cook off which happens yearly. This last year just happened to be the 20th anniversary. People in the community take the competition quite seriously and the festival is a load of fun. That is in no small part due to the amazing character of Cajun people. The Cajuns are a real cultural blend, the French<span id="more-722"></span> component having come from the Acadian people who were thrown out of Canada after the English defeated the French in the early days of the country. About 5,000 settled in South Louisiana. There is also a big Afro-Carribean component as well. One of the things I tried to discover for my show was the root history of Gumbo. It&#8217;s a dish that&#8217;s been around for a long time. I was not able to find the answer locally and that came as a bit of a surprise as I went so far as to find a local scholar who had published a book about the history of Cajun cuisine and she was unable to give me an answer. As it turns out the roots of the dish go back to Africa. I had already come to this conclusion as I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time with families in West Africa (Guinea, Cameroon) and the staple rice-stew dish that they eat is basically a form of Gumbo. This little conundrum got me thinking not about food, but about the nature of history and how it relates to different segments of our society. That brings me back to the war between the English and the French in Canada. The English who won the war and settled French Canada called themselves &#8220;The United Empire Loyalists&#8221; and indeed they were the ones who published the history of Canada in school books which I assume are still studied by Canadian children today. Many generations later a famous Canadian author by the name of Pierre Burton (disclosure, I&#8217;m a big fan) came along and wrote a book called &#8220;The Invasion of Canada&#8221;. This book was not written from the &#8220;official&#8221; crown version of history but compiled from letters written by real foot soldiers and normal every day people. If there were ever a book that illuminated the phrase &#8220;History is written by the Generals&#8221; this one is it. Many of the events that occurred during famous battles during the war or in fact even the true victors of these battles were revealed in the book. The Generals reports to the crown were falsified only to make them look good in the eyes of Queen and country. Now back to Louisiana where the issue I think is less about falsified history than it is about divergent histories. I&#8217;m suggesting that a by-product of racial segregation is that each segment of a segregated society has it&#8217;s own history. In Louisiana I assume that the black populace is at a disadvantage in terms of recorded history due to slavery (pre-civil war). Reading and writing were suppressed in the slave populace to avoid fueling any kind of uprising or organization. So where I&#8217;m going with this is that here we are in 2010, we have a black president which in itself is amazing. Mr. Obama has made it a core part of his platform to address issues of racial segregation in our day and age and of course I&#8217;m 120% behind this initiative. So I pose this question; is it possible to heal the wound of segregation when people living in the same cultural framework have divergent histories? I think the answer is yes. However, I believe that it would be easier and very productive on a community level if we could mount a national initiative to bond our collective histories.  I can&#8217;t think of a better way to move forward the cause of equality and mutual understanding.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a recent trip to mainland China I spent most of my time in a city called <a title="Hangzhou" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou" target="_blank">Hangzhou</a>. The population of this beautiful city is somewhere around 3 million souls. A lot of Chinese people rely on the bicycle for transport as well as scooters. Chinese cities are very congested like their Euro counterparts so two wheeled transport makes sense on pretty much every level (except perhaps safety). But in China there is one difference that is glaringly obvious. Although the roads are packed, and I do mean packed with scooter pilots, the streets are quiet. The reason for this? It&#8217;s because 99% of the scooters are electric.  It&#8217;s quite surreal. It appears to the foreigner like a movie missing a quintessential piece of the sound track. Now here&#8217;s another interesting statistic, around a third of all Chinese bicycles are also electric mopeds or have electric assist. I&#8217;ve also witnessed this phenomenon in Japan where e-bikes and scooters are ubiquitous.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1904334,00.html?iid=digg_share">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1904334,00.html?iid=digg_share</a></p>
<p>This is all very interesting to me because I ride an electric bike and it&#8217;s made in China.</p>
<p><span id="more-464"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_467" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-467" class="size-medium wp-image-467" title="giant" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-300x225.jpg" alt="Giant Lite with Extracycle extension" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-467" class="wp-caption-text">Giant Lite with Extracycle extension</p></div>
<p>I originally built this bike as a camera car. I was shooting the Marathon de Medoc in Bordeaux and wanted to shoot the host of my show in amongst the marathon runners. This is strictly forbidden for motor vehicles but my production manager talked the race organizers into allowing a bicycle on the course. So I built this Giant electric with an <a title="Xtracycle" href="http://www.xtracycle.com/">Xtracycle</a> back end. The bike carried a rider, myself and all of our camera and sound gear for the whole marathon, just under 400 pounds or 200kg. I was sold. When i returned home with the bike it pretty much replaced my car and keep in mind that I live in Los Angeles. My Giant with two batteries has a range of about 60miles and a top (assisted) speed of about 28mph. It can easily carry two people and a weeks worth of groceries. The bike all in cost me around 2,500 USD. Of course the bike uses a bit of generated energy but according to what I&#8217;ve read (sorry no footnotes) it works out to over 800 mpg. If you are really industrious you could invest another $600 in a rooftop solar kit and your bike would be completely off the grid.</p>
<p>I find it kind of astounding that the electric bike or electric scooters haven&#8217;t become popular in North America. I think it&#8217;s partially due to the fact that electric vehicles are not considered to be a practical form of transportation here. An affordable electric car is definitely a ways off (unless you have 90k burning a hole in your pocket to buy a <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Roadster</a>&#8230;drool). But here&#8217;s the thing, electric bike technology is totally capable of providing us with low cost zero emission transport right now. Especially for those of us who live in warmer climates. The only thing that&#8217;s really holding back the manufactures of e-bikes are the laws governing the bikes themselves. Most countries require that the top speed of any assisted bicycle be around 17-19mph. I think that&#8217;s ridiculous considering the fact that anyone in reasonably good shape can pedal a normal road bike a lot faster than that. Now, I&#8217;m not suggesting that legislation should allow unlicensed e-bikes an unlimited top speed, but something closer to 30 mph would be more reasonable and way more practical. That&#8217;s about as fast as your average rider would want to go on a bike anyway and is a totally reasonable speed for urban transport. Fortunately there are ways around these limitations and that&#8217;s what this article is about. Hacking the electric bike!</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>O.K. This is the part where I need to cover my ass. During the course of this article I may be giving you advice that would allow you to make or build your e-bike in such a way that it may go faster than your local laws allow. If you do this and have some kind of horrifying accident where you are dismembered, maimed or in anyway injured. Don&#8217;t come crying to me. Also if you are not completely comfortable on a normal bicycle, I would not recommend going this route first. Buy a nice slow stock e bike and ride it until you&#8217;re really ready to speed things up a bit.</em></p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that any bike can be made electric and it&#8217;s not a difficult process if you are using a ready made kit. I would argue that an e-bike that you construct for yourself will not only be a far superior ride in terms of stability and speed, but way cooler. Off the rack e-bikes are dork-mobiles for the most part, and those that aren&#8217;t are far too expensive for the level of performance they deliver.</p>
<p>O.K. Step one <strong>HACKING THE GIANT LITE</strong></p>
<p>The Giant Lite was by far the best e bike built in it&#8217;s time. It still stands up pretty well next to what&#8217;s out there right now. Granted the motor at 350 watts is a bit underpowered but on the whole it&#8217;s one of the lightest and most efficient off the rack bikes that has ever been made. You can still find new ones on line and they usually about USD $1000. Which is a STEAL compared to other off the rack e-bikes bike out their today.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to try a mod like mine try to find a step through model. The step through makes more sense if your going to extend the back end and make it a two seater. Throwing your leg over the back of a bike that&#8217;s 7 feet long isn&#8217;t so easy. Also I think the step through model is easier to find.</p>
<p>If you are truly in need of step by step advice on how to covert a Giant Lite to a faster viable urban transporter then send me an email and I&#8217;ll send you detailed instructions. I&#8217;m not going to post them here. I&#8217;ve had great success with this bike but I think there are better and cheaper alternatives that have developed since I built it. There are some links to said alternatives at the end of this article.</p>
<p><strong>Batteries:</strong></p>
<p>The Giant uses NiMh batteries and like all rechargeables, they have a finite life-span. The good news is they are easy and inexpensive to refurbish. The even better news is that when you refurbish your batteries you can buy new ones that have a higher storage capacity and will give you more range. The process of upgrading your batteries is called re-celling them. You can buy the kits on-line. The original battery packs for the Giant are around $400. The re-cell kits are half that price.</p>
<p>For any other kit avoid old school led acid batteries. They are cheap, but can&#8217;t be recycled and have a very poor power to weight ratio. There is a good on-line distributor for battery tech:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.batteryspace.com/?SSAID=297581">http://www.batteryspace.com/?SSAID=297581</a></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently investigating LifePO4 batteries as the power source for my next bike. Lithium seems to be the way to go now.</p>
<p>Currently I think the best and also the easiest option is to go with a high output hub motor combined with some advanced battery technology. Just make sure you match the battery voltage to the motor your are powering. Most e-bike systems are either 24 or 36 volt technology. Hub motors can be configured to drive either the front or rear wheel and can be fitted to pretty much any standard bike.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a way to look at existence which involves the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone" target=_new>light cones</a>; at the very least it governs technically the ability we have to communicate, to exchange information, with one another. This is an optimization of how people can exchange voice, image and/or data, because we don&#8217;t simply exchange information at the speed of light between two points in the shortest possible distance <span id="more-516"></span> &mdash; there&#8217;s a plethora of satellite bouncing and non-shortest-distance cable routing, through varying mediums of conductance and transmission, which is being thoroughly hand waved over in this light cone depiction.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2009/10/11/imagining-the-world-without-you/#footnote_0_516" id="identifier_0_516" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="When discussing what governs our ability to exchange information, i&rsquo;m blissfully ignoring &ldquo;spooky action at a distance&rdquo; without qualm until we have become such masters of our domain that we can employ this in our daily lives">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>The idea of the cone is to give an easy visualization as to whether two people, who sit at the base of their own cones, are able to exchange information at any given time. While this is technically a depiction of an evolution of a 4-dimensional surface, it might be more helpful if you think of the cone as a circle on the surface of the earth, which radiates outward from you evenly with time &#8211; like a rock dropped in a pond. As i sit here in San Francisco, starting at any given instant the radius of my light cone grows with time; in under 2 milliseconds, it has grown to cover Los Angeles; less than 10 milliseconds to encompass Mexico City; under 13 milliseconds to Washington D.C; below 22 milliseconds and there&#8217;s Reykjavik; after 30 milliseconds and Paris is part of the union; before 45 milliseconds it&#8217;s taken Mumbai&hellip;</p>
<p>If i should be lucky enough that a person in one of those locales is looking to exchange information with me, then our light cones need only grow for half the time until they meet &mdash; ~in the middle, per se. Should my friend&#8217;s cone not intersect my cone until 2 seconds from now, there&#8217;s no way i can know anything about my friend for another 2 seconds. Adding another turn to the situation, the information which i&#8217;ll hear in 2 seconds is actually &#8216;stale&#8217; information. In much the same way, but on a harshly smaller scale, that our telescopes which spill forth pastorals while trained to night sky reveal not what is, but rather what was: so too will the information received from my friend not represent what is, but what was.</p>
<p>While we still find ourselves inhabiting just planet Earth, the impact of our separated light cones pales in comparison to the impact of our separated time zones, separated continents, separated hemispheres and slow notification systems; the meaningful events of one person&#8217;s day occurring while the other distantly wrestles through fitful sleep serves to sever. It&#8217;s only when we&#8217;ve gone far off-world that our light cones will define our existence; more than 1.2 seconds to the moon, 180 to more than 1330 seconds for Mars, and on and on.</p>
<p>Now or later, we find in either case when we sit in muted silence looking out on to depthless monochrome skies, midst that lack of information and contact, we begin to infer and make up data where none now exists and we&#8217;re left only to imagine the world without you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about the internet is that it brings people together.</p>
<p>One of the unbelievably awful things about the internet is that it mates that &#8216;bringing together of people&#8217; with the double curse of the average human: (1) the difficulty to discriminate in choice and (2) the propensity to hoard and believe that more is better. What results from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_(1986_film)" target=_new>Fly</a> like merging is lived out daily by tens of millions on sites like Facebook. Multiplying the penalty of living this out on such sites is that, unlike some night in 1992 that faded out to muted shades as time went by, massive farms of servers are busy replicating and archiving your mistakes right now, so that the future you, the future friends, the future employers, perhaps the future children, can see it as clearly as though it just happened.</p>
<p>Welcome to the end of valuable friendships: a modern tragic play in four parts. <span id="more-306"></span></p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act I</b><br />
<em>Your friend&#8217;s friend is a two-dimensional fuckwit</em></center><br />
</p>
<p>Looking back, there were those things said in passing over dinner, and the odd second hand tale. It seems like the clues were always there, waiting to be assembled: your dear friend has some good friends who are real douche bags; they haven&#8217;t a cupful of wit nor a minute ember of humor to douse with it. You always suspected it but you could never <em>prove it</em> &mdash; until now. Day in and day out, your friend&#8217;s update feed becomes a longer and longer laundry list of unfunny non-insights and retorts which weren&#8217;t even amusing when they first became public domain in the 1980s.<br />
You can no longer deny it: here are the buffoons willingly added, and continuing to be kept, by your friend as their friends&hellip; and they&#8217;re schmucks: screamingly obvious, self-promoting, flying-a-flag morons. Your mind races:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:18px;">
<li>How does this person who i&#8217;ve come to hold in high esteem have such lousy taste?</li>
<li>What does it mean for my own self-worth to be a friend of someone who has such lousy taste?</li>
</ul>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act II</b><br />
<em>A hole that can never be filled</em><br />
</p>
<p>20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and on and on; and more and more&hellip; Like <em>Romeo is Bleeding</em>, your friend has to fill that hole, but instead of cash in the backyard, they can&#8217;t stay away from that Add button. It becomes a tired, hackneyed, ritual which has lost nearly all value and thereby has cheapened that for which it once had value. Nobody has 150 friends. Simply nobody. You can&#8217;t say for sure that you&#8217;ve even had meaningful conversations with 150 different people in your entire adult life&hellip; but there it sits: your friend&#8217;s &#8220;friend&#8221; list. What does it even mean? Even making the statement that someone has 200 friends would have been vapid braggadocio in recent times, and yet here it is as some item of pride on the front page of your-friend-the-prom-queen&#8217;s profile. And still everyday, there&#8217;s a new one, a new five. Where do they keep finding them? How many items can a collector really pay loving attention to?</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act III</b><br />
<em>Tear Down This Wall! <span style="font-size:smaller;">(even if it&#8217;s supporting the roof)</span></em></center><br />
</p>
<p>Five years ago, the idea of an adult hanging out frequently with both their parents and peers in a social situation would have been solely the hallmark of the tacky white trash.</p>
<p>Five years ago, the idea of a barely known co-worker and a friend-for-the-past-fifteen-years together regularly sharing your conversation and comment would have been impossible &mdash; obviously fucking wrong.</p>
<p>Today, these are part of life-de-facto on social network sites like Facebook. Evaporating is the concept of &#8216;appropriateness&#8217;. Bob, from human resources, three jobs ago, is treated to seeing your friend&#8217;s children photos &#8211; just like you are. Your friend commenting on Brenda&#8217;s photo of her baby is given the same profile screen real estate as anything else your friend does, even though you don&#8217;t know who in the world Brenda is and couldn&#8217;t give a good god damn. On your friend&#8217;s profile, you can read your half of the conversation your friend had with their parent when (a) why is it the public&#8217;s business, and (b) you didn&#8217;t want to know, and (c) seeing only half of something not only makes no sense, but also inspires curiosity in something you didn&#8217;t want to know to begin with.</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act IV</b><br />
<em>Everyone is a King or Queen</em></center><br />
</p>
<p>&hellip; so, much like all of the want-to-be-somebodies who flocked daily to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles" target=_new>Versailles</a> in the 1700s to stay in favour, you too get up every morning to attend your friend&#8217;s court. What is it today that might be proclaimed to that court of those awaiting hundreds of friends &mdash; that passing remark that you&#8217;d like to be a part of because they are, after all, still your friend.<br />
Dirtied and devalued is the notion of privacy: the transience of a special shared moment, lost to archiving on third party servers and replicated; backed up databases; off-site-stored media; there, always stark, never going away; often available for others to read, weeks, months, and years later, and best of-all: out of context. This is a dark rabbit hole from which there&#8217;s no return.</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Epilogue</b></center><br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps this is just the way humans will evolve, like birds in a pet store, we will become all a large mishmash of people twittering-posting-and-otherwise-babbling, simultaneously, en masse, about nothing of any particular importance. Perhaps that will become what is usual and regular. It&#8217;s too early to tell.</p>
<p>One thing seems for certain: it cheapens us all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Anxiety may have been the first effect. My heart began to race and the fat, shouting stand-up comic on the television grew unbearably irritating.<span> </span>&#8220;Time to turn this shit off,&#8221; I told The Chemist. The bedroom in The Chemist’s flat, comfortable just a moment ago, seemed to grow smaller and threatened to become too confining.<span> </span>I sat on the bed and tried to subdue this ominous feeling.<span> </span>I didn’t want the fear of bad trip to become the very cause of one.<span> </span>The Chemist paced about, turned off the television, shuffled through a disorganized stack of CDs.<span> </span>He too was beginning to feel increasingly agitated.<span> </span>Half an hour had passed with no certain result.<span> </span>But, we both knew, results were certainly forthcoming:<span> </span>An <a href="http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/nmr/inside.htm">NMR</a> had been performed to ensure that the synthesis was exactly correct, and we measured our dosages according to bodyweight, consuming a &#8220;high, safe dose&#8221; as specified in a <a href="http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:iJBJj79QloAJ:www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/GriffithsPsilocybin.pdf+psilocybin+mystical+experience&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us">Johns Hopkins University study</a>.  <span id="more-30"></span> <em></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had fired a brief email to William just before taking the capsule: &#8220;I am about to take a trip measured in milligrams.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He would know what that was about. I thought it might be nice to speak with him during the trip for professional guidance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">…He knows about these kinds of things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Already I worried that I was somewhere in the preliminaries of a bad trip.<span> </span>I focused on my breathing while staring at the various posters covering the wall opposite me.<span> </span>Then, something odd happened.<span> </span>The posters suddenly defied the linear confines of the wall behind them, some floating out to the foreground, others sinking back at varying depths.<span> </span><em><span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All at once, the anxiety had passed and curiosity gripped me as space slowly altered around me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I reported all this to The Chemist who agreed that he too was now undeniably experiencing something quite beyond placebo.<span> </span>We decided to move into the Living Room, where we could lounge more comfortably on the couches.<span> </span>The Chemist only asked that I try to keep my head and maintain some sense of propriety should one of his roommates arrive.<span> </span>As this was my only psychedelic excursion, I couldn’t make any guarantees regarding my affected behaviour, but I promised I’d do my best&#8230;<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/06/18/psilocybin/#footnote_0_30" id="identifier_0_30" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Many people, while getting to know me, are surprised to learn that I am for the most part &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, and relatively inexperienced in recreational, or experimental, drug use. For one reason or another I seem to come off with an air of drugs savvy I don&rsquo;t possess. Yet, a good number of my closest friends are not the least bit ashamed to be classified as drug-users. On the other hand, The Church of Scientology, when I underwent their &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; (for both my own amusement and as a segment of my Process research) claimed that recreational drug use wasn&rsquo;t a natural behaviour for a person of my character. I have the questionable distinction of having scored well on their character analysis examination, and this score &ndash; taken together with my Intelligence Test results &ndash; indicated a drug-free mind.  These traits, the scientologists reasoned, colluded to make me a sound and sober individual. But then, with circular logic, they also claimed that these traits were a natural by-product of my sobriety. Either way &ndash; and as with most things &ndash; I feel that the Scientologists are wrong. I believe my abstention to be a matter of nurture rather than nature. A friend of mine once speculated that, had I been raised in an environment wherein illegal drug-usage had been rare, my natural contrarian tendencies would have led me into the life of a junkie. As it is, early exposure to addicts convinced me that recreational drug usage didn&rsquo;t do anybody any &ldquo;good&rdquo;.">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When upright and ambulatory, the more dramatic effects of the drug were dampened.<span> </span>The most intense experiences occurred when stationary, eyes closed.<span> </span>Psilocybin confounded my preconceived notion of the psychedelic experience as primarily visual.<span> </span>I was pleased to find that all the senses conspired to the extent that changes in my very posture subtly altered the entire ambiance.<span> </span>Nor were the visual hallucinations themselves as entirely independent of my conscious thoughts as I may have believed.<span> </span>The hallucinatory effect, for me, was mostly dependant upon associations derived through a heightened sense of <a href="http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html">pareidolia</a>.<span> </span>I distinguished distinct images in random patterns, and I began to feel that certain objects looked quite a bit like something else entirely, even though I remained completely aware of the reality of their shape.<span> </span>My mind tended to isolate the embedded swastika in a pattern of alternating rectangles on a folded quilt upon a chair and among the outlines of squares on a grid pattern on the wall.<span> </span>Every object became a stationary life form:<span> </span>Smooth surfaces, insect shells; soft objects, fleshy masses… everything surface just an outer layer concealing moist viscera and meat.<span> </span>Underneath, everything was alive.<span> </span>This was a non-visual hallucination.<span> </span>A psychotic idea.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The outlines of angled objects extended their boundaries in the peripherals of my vision, as in an architect’s rough sketch.<span> </span>To look at anything directly destroyed the illusion and, as mentioned, the whole experience was far more mundane when observed through open eyes.<span> </span>With my eyes closed, my mind lost the visual framework of my body to fit its kinesthetic sense to.<span> </span>My left arm stretched and lengthened to twice normal, while the fingers did likewise, reaching into a shifting, luminescent abyss.<span> </span>Oddly, my right arm withered to little more than a nub.<span> </span>Sitting Japanese-style on my knees, my legs melted into themselves and all but disappeared from consciousness.<span> </span>My head was reduced to little more than a floating eye.<span> </span>A strange tickling sensation made me aware of my spine.<span> </span>When I rose to use the lavatory, this tickling of the spine caused me to walk in exaggerated motions.<span> </span>“I feel like a cartoon bug” I told The Chemist, looking more like a pantomime thief with my long tip-toed lurches and wild counter-balancing arm gestures.<span> </span>The toilet was to the end of the hall which had, it seemed, grown considerably in length since last I’d seen it.<span> </span><em>It would be convenient</em>, it occurred to me, <em>if I could just close my eyes, reach my extended left arm into the distant lavatory, point into the toilet and piss out my index finger.<span> </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Best not to try it,</em> I decided,<em> lest I piss my pants.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I wondered if these lunatic ideas would overcome me to the point in which I would actually be pissing myself, sawing off extraneous left arm, and who-knows-what.<span> </span>Despite this possibility, it was pleasing to note that I was calm and unafraid.<span> </span>Fear simply was not in me.<span> </span>The Fear Mechanism seemed so entirely numbed that it occurred to me that an intruding murderer would find me unimpressed and complaisant.<span> </span><em>How is it possible, </em>I began to wonder, <em>for anybody to have the “Bad Trip” on psilocybin?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then, terror nearly struck as I reached the end of the hall and beheld the toilet.<span> </span>The seat of the toilet – a varnished wood model – provoked a grotesquely deformed visual association.<span> </span>Most of the toilet seats that I am familiar with are shaped like a U curved inward (more like an upended C) with a stopper at each end.<span> </span><em>This</em> toilet seat, while of the standard shape, was equipped with <em>four </em>stoppers – one extra at each lower end of the curve.<span> </span><em>Who would do this?!<span> </span></em>The stoppers looked much like eyes – this toilet had <em>four</em>! – and they leveled an incriminating gaze over its imposing, gaping maw.<span> </span>The toilet had taken the general visage of some ancient North American god, and I was impiously to pee into its mouth?<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>I could just pee into the sink…</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There I went again.<span> </span><em>Get a hold of yourself, you idiot.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I regarded myself in the mirror, something I had been specifically advised not to do while under the influence of psilocybin.<span> </span>One has a tendency, I had been told, to see horrifying shape-shifting deformities, melting flesh, and monstrous defects in the mirror through psychedelic eyes.<span> </span>I scrutinized my features.<span> </span>My face maintained its integrity.  In fact, I wore it well.<span> </span><span> </span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I felt a need to keep a hold of the wall as I walked back down the hall toward the Living Room (more to establish a physical hold on reality than for balance).<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Chemist was having a grim episode of introspection.<span> </span>He began expressing self-doubt and insecurity regarding his current life path.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Get a hold of yourself, you idiot!”<span> </span>I encouraged him. <span> </span>I hoped I could placate him and prevent him from compromising the peak I felt myself reaching.<span> </span>My psilocybin experience was reaching a whole new level of intensity and I was delighted that, despite the strong reservations that had prevented me from experimenting with mind-altering substances in the past, I was well at home with what I was experiencing now. <span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I closed my eyes and watched hidden images briefly surface and disappear in an expansive void that appeared something like a three dimensional television static with the individual black, white and grey bits writhing and contorting like millions of translucent ghostly maggots.<span> </span>The brief images formed and faded &#8211; sometimes elaborate and geometrical, other times animal-like and animated – despite my best efforts to retain their vision and make sense of their “meaning”.<span> </span>I felt that I was looking directly upon the patterns that form the basis of my subconscious, atavistic mind.<span> </span>I wondered if it was a failing of mine that I found myself unable to make more sense of it all.<span> </span>I felt that with the proper training, with some esoteric method, I would be able to navigate this internal world more sensibly, and learn more from it. <span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I considered this, my kinesthetic sense again distorted, transforming me into a hemispherical flat surface.<span> </span>The entire environment, still a chaotic static, also flattened becoming one with my body and forming the opposite surface of the sphere I was now looking into – not from <em>without</em>, but <em>as</em>.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I felt that I had gained some type of godlike dominance over this uncharted territory… but I lamented that I had no I had no idea what to do with it, and I somehow knew that this bizarre but enjoyable perception was to be fleeting.<span> </span>With arms outstretched, I flexed my hands, causing the orb to lightly pulsate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My mind had deranged, turned inside-out, and the dark hidden corners were brought to the surface in full exposure.<span> </span>Introspection was inevitable, and mine seemed to be carried out on some level throughout the entire trip.<span> </span>Like The Chemist, I began considering the very validity of everything I am currently involved in: my job, my studies, my creative projects and independent research.  Happily, I came to conclusion that <em>all of the things that I am involved in now are exactly those things which I should be involved in now, and even if they are ultimately &#8220;unsuccessful&#8221;, I can do nothing more than see them through to their conclusion.</em> <em>Everything</em>, I convinced myself, <em>will work out as it should</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>As it is, so be it</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The internal voice that worked to sooth my unquiet mind resonated with a new authority, its answers certain and absolute.  These answers came not as opinions, but epiphanies.  <em>Everything would be okay</em>.<span> </span>I was certain of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I conveyed this information to The Chemist.  Then I called a friend of mine in Detroit and belaboured her with maniac rantings.  While speaking to her, I was struck by the fact that I wasn&#8217;t as articulate as I felt I was.  It had seemed as though my conscious mind were still entirely rational, observing this alteration of the senses more-or-less unaffected, but this uncharacteristic inability to find proper words suggested otherwise.  Perhaps I&#8217;d retarded my reason after all.  Perhaps I&#8217;d be permanently affected, reduced to a hellish existence lumbering about a swastika-decorated world, babbling like a fool, with my True Self exiled somewhere within wailing, &#8220;Would to God I&#8217;d never done it!  Would to God I&#8217;d never done it!&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">…I couldn&#8217;t convince myself that this was a serious concern.  The psilocybin seemed to be following a path, a direction.  The peak had passed (somewhere in the orb), and though it faded very slowly, I was certain that this trip would eventually end.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I ended my phone call and voiced senseless profundities to The Chemist.  I began to feel as though I were enjoying myself at his expense, that I had somehow hoarded all the fun and positivity to myself while leaving him to his own devices.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But by now, the effects of the psilocybin were slowly wearing off.  The Chemist grew more lucid and nonchalant, having regained perspective, sensible enough to not take his psychedelic mental wanderings too terribly seriously.  We went outdoors so that he could smoke a cigarette.  He spoke more like a disappointed tourist who had lost his sunglasses on a rollercoaster than the victim of a traumatized psyche.  I felt that my own positive experience was testament to a certain level of emotional fortitude that I now knew I possessed.  Little did I know that only a month later all anxiety would not only have fully returned, but would strike so hard that it would be followed by a prolonged illness, during which I would lose 20 pounds before recovering&#8230;  So much for long-term benefits&#8230;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We went back indoors.  The Chemist retired to his bedroom while I returned to the Living Room and attempted to fall asleep on the couch.  My mind refused rest, still racing with unfamiliar activity.  I was exhausted and just wanted it to stop.  I faded into sleep with difficulty, but psilocybin and I parted on decidedly amiable terms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_30" class="footnote">Many people, while getting to know me, are surprised to learn that I am for the most part &#8220;clean&#8221;, and relatively inexperienced in recreational, or experimental, drug use.<span> </span>For one reason or another I seem to come off with an air of drugs savvy I don’t possess.<span> </span>Yet, a good number of my closest friends are not the least bit ashamed to be classified as drug-users.<span> </span>On the other hand, The Church of Scientology, when I underwent their &#8220;orientation&#8221; (for both my own amusement and as a segment of my Process research) claimed that recreational drug use wasn&#8217;t a natural behaviour for a person of my character. I have the questionable distinction of having scored well on their character analysis examination, and this score &#8211; taken together with my Intelligence Test results &#8211; indicated a drug-free mind.  These traits, the scientologists reasoned, colluded to make me a sound and sober individual.<span> </span>But then, with circular logic, they also claimed that these traits were a natural by-product of my sobriety.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In vampire lore it has been said that a vampire cannot enter your house unless they are invited. This is useful to remember because the world is indeed full of vampires. They come in all shapes and sizes and walk among us every day. Now, I am not speaking about the kind with long teeth, black clothes and pale skin. I happen to know many of those people and I can tell you from personal experience that many of them are most excellent beings and, unless you take away their absinthe, they are pretty much harmless (little joke mes amis). If blood=life and life=energy then I speak of people who feed on the energy of others and offer nothing in return.<span id="more-27"></span><br />
Much like the mythology, they are often created by the deeds of another vampire. Some sort of physical/mental/sexually abusive situation that leads to a traumatic imprint that years of therapy and/or pharmaceuticals can rarely undo. They spend the rest of their lives attempting to burn the house down in a futile attempt to obtain the improbable goal of revenge or understanding. Sometimes it&#8217;s just pure desperation. In a worst case scenario they are simply a bad example of a human being. I once interviewed a gentlemen who was the head of field operations for Medicine San Frontiers (In case you don&#8217;t recognize the moniker M.S.F. is an aid organization which is not tied to any governing body. Their modus operandi allows them to operate in very extreme situations because they help anyone on any side of a given conflict) he had spent a great deal of time working in the midst of some of the worst contemporary human crisis. I asked him how the experience of working for the organization had altered his perception of humans. He said &#8220;You know, I think that people in west have this idea that at the heart of every person there is an altruistic being, but I don&#8217;t believe that. I&#8217;ve met (and treated) men who have hacked children to pieces with machete&#8217;s and not only were they good at it, they enjoyed it.&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s a bit hard to recover from that kind of comment. How do we live in a world in which there are people who think and act this way? The fact is there are people like this living in your neighborhood. There are people who do not value any life except their own. They cannot be reasoned with and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever be rid of them because we all have the ability to cultivate a dark heart. But (and this is where I jump on the Dali Lama&#8217;s bandwagon) we also have the ability to cultivate compassion and to mark the 40th anniversary of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUtL_0vAJk&amp;feature=related" title="Martin Luther Kings" target="_blank">Martin Luther Kings</a> death I wholeheartedly argue that this is the only way forward.</p>
<p>My argument is that we, you, I have a choice. For some, that choice is much harder to make than for others but none the less it&#8217;s there. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed a few books by the late communications theorist Neil Postman. In one book he published what he described as an open source speech for any valedictorian to be who might be in need of one. It&#8217;s a very good piece and does a far better job of illustrating my point than I do. Please read on&#8230;</p>
<p>MY GRADUATION SPEECH<br />
by Neil Postman</p>
<p>Having sat through two dozen or so graduation speeches, I have naturally wondered why they are so often so bad. One reason, of course, is that the speakers are chosen for their eminence in some field, and not because they are either competent speakers or gifted writers. Another reason is that the audience is eager to be done with all ceremony so that it can proceed to some serious reveling. Thus any speech longer than, say, fifteen minutes will seem tedious, if not entirely pointless. There are other reasons as well, including the difficulty of saying something inspirational without being banal. Here I try my hand at writing a graduation speech, and not merely to discover if I can conquer the form. This is precisely what I would like to say to young people if I had their attention for a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you think my graduation speech is good, I hereby grant you permission to use it, without further approval from or credit to me, should you be in an appropriate situation.</p>
<p>Members of the faculty, parents, guests, and graduates, have no fear. I am well aware that on a day of such high excitement, what you require, first and foremost, of any speaker is brevity. I shall not fail you in this respect. There are exactly eighty-five sentences in my speech, four of which you have just heard. It will take me about twelve minutes to speak all of them and I must tell you that such economy was not easy for me to arrange, because I have chosen as my topic the complex subject of your ancestors. Not, of course, your biological ancestors, about whom I know nothing, but your spiritual ancestors, about whom I know a little. To be specific, I want to tell you about two groups of people who lived many years ago but whose influence is still with us. They were very different from each other, representing opposite values and traditions. I think it is appropriate for you to be reminded of them on this day because, sooner than you know, you must align yourself with the spirit of one or the spirit of the other.</p>
<p>The first group lived about 2,500 years ago in the place which we now call Greece, in a city they called Athens. We do not know as much about their origins as we would like. But we do know a great deal about their accomplishments. They were, for example, the first people to develop a complete alphabet, and therefore they became the first truly literate population on earth. They invented the idea of political democracy, which they practiced with a vigor that puts us to shame. They invented what we call philosophy. And they also invented what we call logic and rhetoric. They came very close to inventing what we call science, and one of them-Democritus by name-conceived of the atomic theory of matter 2,300 years before it occurred to any modern scientist. They composed and sang epic poems of unsurpassed beauty and insight. And they wrote and performed plays that, almost three millennia later, still have the power to make audiences laugh and weep. They even invented what, today, we call the Olympics, and among their values none stood higher than that in all things one should strive for excellence. They believed in reason. They believed in beauty. They believed in moderation. And they invented the word and the idea which we know today as ecology.</p>
<p>About 2,000 years ago, the vitality of their culture declined and these people began to disappear. But not what they had created. Their imagination, art, politics, literature, and language spread all over the world so that, today, it is hardly possible to speak on any subject without repeating what some Athenian said on the matter 2,500 years ago.</p>
<p>The second group of people lived in the place we now call Germany, and flourished about 1,700 years ago. We call them the Visigoths, and you may remember that your sixth or seventh-grade teacher mentioned them. They were spectacularly good horsemen, which is about the only pleasant thing history can say of them. They were marauders-ruthless and brutal. Their language lacked subtlety and depth. Their art was crude and even grotesque. They swept down through Europe destroying everything in their path, and they overran the Roman Empire. There was nothing a Visigoth liked better than to burn a book, desecrate a building, or smash a work of art. From the Visigoths, we have no poetry, no theater, no logic, no science, no humane politics.</p>
<p>Like the Athenians, the Visigoths also disappeared, but not before they had ushered in the period known as the Dark Ages. It took Europe almost a thousand years to recover from the Visigoths.</p>
<p>Now, the point I want to make is that the Athenians and the Visigoths still survive, and they do so through us and the ways in which we conduct our lives. All around us-in this hall, in this community, in our city-there are people whose way of looking at the world reflects the way of the Athenians, and there are people whose way is the way of the Visigoths. I do not mean, of course, that our modern-day Athenians roam abstractedly through the streets reciting poetry and philosophy, or that the modern-day Visigoths are killers. I mean that to be an Athenian or a Visigoth is to organize your life around a set of values. An Athenian is an idea. And a Visigoth is an idea. Let me tell you briefly what these ideas consist of.</p>
<p>To be an Athenian is to hold knowledge and, especially the quest for knowledge in high esteem. To contemplate, to reason, to experiment, to question-these are, to an Athenian, the most exalted activities a person can perform. To a Visigoth, the quest for knowledge is useless unless it can help you to earn money or to gain power over other people.</p>
<p>To be an Athenian is to cherish language because you believe it to be humankind&#8217;s most precious gift. In their use of language, Athenians strive for grace, precision, and variety. And they admire those who can achieve such skill. To a Visigoth, one word is as good as another, one sentence in distinguishable from another. A Visigoth&#8217;s language aspires to nothing higher than the cliché.</p>
<p>To be an Athenian is to understand that the thread which holds civilized society together is thin and vulnerable; therefore, Athenians place great value on tradition, social restraint, and continuity. To an Athenian, bad manners are acts of violence against the social order. The modern Visigoth cares very little about any of this. The Visigoths think of themselves as the center of the universe. Tradition exists for their own convenience, good manners are an affectation and a burden, and history is merely what is in yesterday&#8217;s newspaper.</p>
<p>To be an Athenian is to take an interest in public affairs and the improvement of public behavior. Indeed, the ancient Athenians had a word for people who did not. The word was idiotes, from which we get our word &#8220;idiot.&#8221; A modern Visigoth is interested only in his own affairs and has no sense of the meaning of community.</p>
<p>And, finally, to be an Athenian is to esteem the discipline, skill, and taste that are required to produce enduring art. Therefore, in approaching a work of art, Athenians prepare their imagination through learning and experience. To a Visigoth, there is no measure of artistic excellence except popularity. What catches the fancy of the multitude is good. No other standard is respected or even acknowledged by the Visigoth.</p>
<p>Now, it must be obvious what all of this has to do with you. Eventually, like the rest of us, you must be on one side or the other. You must be an Athenian or a Visigoth. Of course, it is much harder to be an Athenian, for you must learn how to be one, you must work at being one, whereas we are all, in a way, natural-born Visigoths. That is why there are so many more Visigoths than Athenians. And I must tell you that you do not become an Athenian merely by attending school or accumulating academic degrees. My father-in-law was one of the most committed Athenians I have ever known, and he spent his entire adult life working as a dress cutter on Seventh Avenue in New York City. On the other hand, I know physicians, lawyers, and engineers who are Visigoths of unmistakable persuasion. And I must also tell you, as much in sorrow as in shame, that at some of our great universities, perhaps even this one, there are professors of whom we may fairly say they are closet Visigoths. And yet, you must not doubt for a moment that a school, after all, is essentially an Athenian idea. There is a direct link between the cultural achievements of Athens and what the faculty at this university is all about. I have no difficulty imagining that Plato, Aristotle, or Democritus would be quite at home in our class rooms. A Visigoth would merely scrawl obscenities on the wall.</p>
<p>And so, whether you were aware of it or not, the purpose of your having been at this university was to give you a glimpse of the Athenian way, to interest you in the Athenian way. We cannot know on this day how many of you will choose that way and how many will not. You are young and it is not given to us to see your future. But I will tell you this, with which I will close: I can wish for you no higher compliment than that in the future it will be reported that among your graduating class the Athenians mightily outnumbered the Visigoths.</p>
<p>Thank you, and congratulations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am one of those people who rarely remembers my dreams but jet lag has thrown me the keys to Pandora&#8217;s flat for the time being. The other night I dreamt that I died. It wasn&#8217;t anything dramatic, no fiery plane crash, no end of the world scenario. It just occurred to me that it was happening and was irreversible. <span id="more-25"></span> I believe I was in the middle of designing something. Again, nothing special, but i was really enjoying the moment. Someone close to me was nearby and started freaking out and in my dream I spent my last moments doing three things.<br />
Firstly I tried to calm the person down. Not only for their well being but also because I really didn&#8217;t want someone around wigging out during the BIG moment. Secondly I started thinking about all the people in my life that I love and who are part of the fabric of who I perceive myself to be. Lastly, I just kept doing what I was doing.</p>
<p>If I were to interpret this dream, something which I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time doing, I would say that I was projecting my ideal state of mind in the context of the situation. That is to say that if I were dying, it&#8217;s kind of the way I&#8217;d like to deal with it. The really interesting thing about the dream was that I simply wasn&#8217;t afraid. All I wanted to do was finish up what I was working on quietly before I died. Had I been sweeping the floor I would have wanted to simply empty the dust bin first.<br />
This is Mecca for me. It&#8217;s what I strive for above all things in my life. To embrace death, rather than to avoid it. As I get older I find that I look at people and try to understand them by knowing what it is that they love, and fear. I generally end up being close to the ones who embrace both. Fear is the proverbial elephant in the room but its ubiquitous nature makes it semi transparent. Just the way most people like it. I think that&#8217;s too bad because it is the great leveler. Doesn&#8217;t matter how rich, smart, beautiful or strong you are. If I walk into the room holding the thing that you fear the most you will quickly revert to your base self and in most cases be rendered powerless. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s the great tool of the oppressor.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to remind you, yes YOU, that you are going to die. Nothing is going to stop it and science, although it may buy you a bit more time, is not going to save you. At least not in the near future. You might drop dead of an aneurysm or die slowly of a really horrible disease (which seems to be one of the major fears people hold) or you might die peacefully in your sleep. Whatever, it&#8217;s happening and I would say that there is a very good chance that NOTHING is waiting for you on the other side. Now, if you take this grim news and post it on your fridge, or get it tattooed on the inside of your eyelids where you cannot avoid it well, something interesting might happen. You might, just might slowly come to the realization that you really don&#8217;t have anything to lose (in the big picture sense).<br />
That&#8217;s pretty liberating and it puts your fears in a different light.<br />
When I was a kid I was scared shitless of amusement park rides. I got over it one day by getting on the Zipper (still a freaky ride) alone. It was one of the great defining moments of my life, lost I&#8217;m sure, on the carnie operating the ride. So now when i am cresting the first hill of some ginormous roller coaster (or about to face some big fear in my life) I don&#8217;t close my eyes even though I still feel fear. I put my arms up in the air and scream my guts out. I always find that on the other side of that rush of fear is a heightened sense of clarity and confidence.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Innocence&#8221; is often merely a euphemism for gullibility, and it&#8217;s this quality that typically endears children to adults.  Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and Jesus all entered our tender, nascent minds without troublesome critical inquiries, so often the demon enemy of adult happiness.  Liquor is often needed to bring the &#8220;magic&#8221; back, and in retrospect, I think my First Grade teacher was a drunkard.  Or worse.  Her moods were erratic.  She oscillated from sedate, glassy-eyed trances to wild-eyed hysterics.  She wasn&#8217;t taken in by our &#8220;innocence&#8221;.  She knew full well what savage little beasts we were, and that without the proper subordination we&#8217;d break off into primal tribes, murdering the fat kids in ad hoc rituals.  With the proper organization and physical strength, we&#8217;d have had her on a rotisserie before Nap Time.<span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p>Her behaviour indicated that she understood this.</p>
<p>One day, She spontaneously broke into tears and tore up a female classmate&#8217;s art project: a construction paper jack-o-lantern with tears coming from its eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always draw everything with tears in its eyes,&#8221; she wailed, collapsing &#8211; ironically &#8211; in sobs.</p>
<p>The class was a regimented prison camp.  Unauthorized communication was forbidden.  We were issued ID numbers for head-count, and desks which we were charged with keeping immaculate.  When She spoke, we listened &#8211; nothing more.  Everybody tried to remain anonymous.  I often had questions, but this was no environment for my petty hair-splitting.  Just the same, when She collected us together at story time to tell us about the Send a Mouse to College programme, I was intensely curious.  This programme, we were told, allowed us to sponsor a mouse&#8230; in College!</p>
<p>I knew how the educational system broke down back then; Kindergarten was for babies.  Elementary School was for growing tots like me.  Middle School was for big kids, almost adults&#8230; complex concepts would be introduced.  High School?  The intellectual battlefield that separated the weak from the strong, deciding who would &#8211; and who would not &#8211; make it to College.  College was strictly for dedicated academics&#8230; brains, geniuses.</p>
<p>In the first grade, we couldn&#8217;t be expected to understand a damned thing in the College curriculum, and yet here we were being told that there <em>mice</em> that had achieved this level of scholarly discipline.</p>
<p>The pamphlet, which we were required to bring home to our parents, bore an artistic rendering of the idealized mouse scholar, all smiles, proudly gripping his rolled parchment.</p>
<p><em>Could this be?</em></p>
<p>I had to ask: &#8220;Do we get to meet the mice that we sponsor?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was exasperated by my ignorance and impudence.  &#8220;Just give the pamphlet to your parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later that night, I begged my parents to donate to the programme.  They weren&#8217;t persuaded.</p>
<p>My older brother disabused me of this particular &#8220;innocence&#8221;.  &#8220;The mice aren&#8217;t students,&#8221; he informed me, &#8220;they are test subjects.  They are dissected and killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I called him an idiot.  Who would want to send a mouse to College for that?</p>
<p>Insane.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I followed up with my mother.  A little hesitantly, she agreed with my brother.  These were lab rats.</p>
<p>I felt betrayed.  I&#8217;d been had.  But I got over it soon enough.  My attention didn&#8217;t hold to anything too terribly long at that age.</p>
<p>Years later, I would recall the Send a Mouse to College programme in disbelief.  &#8220;Can you believe they pulled that stunt on us?&#8221;  I asked friends of mine.  They were perplexed.  None of them remembered any such programme.  Was I sure?  Not really, the more I thought about it.  So I searched for information.  There wasn&#8217;t much, but I imagined there had to have been some outcry about this at some point.  I found that the programme had been contrived by the American Cancer Society (ACS), so I called them to ask about it.  I told them that I was thinking about writing an article about the programme, so they put me in touch with one of their PR flacks in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Her name was Karen Rouse, and despite her annoying tendency to continually mention the ACS&#8217;s financial contributions to the University I am in attendance of, I found her to be amiable and helpful.  Of course, that&#8217;s her job, but I&#8217;ll take it at face value.&#8221;It does seem a bit weird by today&#8217;s standards,&#8221; Rouse admitted,   &#8220;It&#8217;s antiquated.  But, at the time, we were trying to educate children.  We wanted to get them thinking about cancer and about research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rouse, who has been with the ACS for 34 years, and remembered <em>Send a Mouse to College</em> from personal experience, acknowledged that the campaign upset a few children and parents who found the usage of pamphlets and literature depicting the happy mouse, holding a diploma, deceptive.  &#8220;We did start to get letters; very heart-felt letters.  I remember one in particular from a boy, probably about 12 years old, in the mid-seventies.  He said that he wanted to help in the fight against cancer, but he wanted to know if there was something else he could do that didn&#8217;t entail sending a rodent to its death.&#8221;  According to her, the quantity of negative letters was significant, but not copious.  &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say that there was a ground-swell of these letters, but it did run its course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out, no organized objection to the campaign &#8211; which ran, according to Rouse&#8217;s recollection, from the mid-sixties to the early eighties &#8211; ever surfaced.</p>
<p>She explained that during the eighties, the ACS began to focus more on teaching children about cancer prevention, focusing primarily on tobacco and the usage of sunscreen.  &#8220;We [the ACS] moved away from programmes like <em>Send a Mouse to College</em>, because it had run its course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today,&#8221; says Rouse, &#8220;childhood cancer is considered 99% Treatable.&#8221;  Also, the ACS today is able to raise $425 million annually in nationwide research funding. She credits this in part to awareness campaigns like <em>Send a Mouse to College</em>.  As for the efficacy of the <em>Send a Mouse to College</em> campaign itself: &#8220;I have no idea how extensive the campaign was.  I know it was nationwide, but I have no record of how many schools were involved or how much money was ultimately raised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, Rouse&#8217;s answers were contrived and scripted &#8211; which is merely to say that she was cautious, not dishonest.  At points, I felt as though she were actually reading to me.  She seemed to sense trouble from a journalist exploring such territory.  She tried to get a feel for my angle.  Where was I coming from?  What did I want?  Was I outraged?</p>
<p>No, not really.  I was, but not anymore.  I still think it was stupid campaign, but nothing worth exacting bitter revenge over.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I never wrote the intended article for publication.</p>
<p>People are just too touchy about these kinds of things&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>William is packing for, and in transit to, Italy this week where he&#8217;ll be doing  a couple months of work on The American Memory Project with Justin Bennett. So, you&#8217;ll have just Doug and myself this cycle.</em></p>
<p>Many known belief systems in the world feature the idea of a &#8216;soul&#8217; — a sentient component of an entire human being; in most of these systems, the existence of this soul continues beyond the corporeal existence of the human being, maintaining some carry over from its time spent in the host body (depending on belief system, ranging from actual memories and feelings, to more hand-waving-vagaries like &#8216;psychic energy&#8217;). I won&#8217;t address the varying theories about where these souls are supposed to come from, what their state of existence is prior to the physical existence of the host form, which is an article unto its own; i will, instead, focus on what the continual march of scientific discovery brings to light on dark age notions of the soul.<span id="more-22"></span></p>
<p>Let me define what a &#8216;state machine&#8217; is; it&#8217;s a bit of a nerdy term which might detract a bit from what you may have anticipated just reading the title. (If so, i say, &#8216;you&#8217;ve already bought the horse, so you might as well give it a ride.&#8217;)<br />
The &#8216;state&#8217; of an object can be thought of as a description of all of the meaningful attributes of that object at any specific instant in time. For example, the state of my car this morning could be described (incompletely) like, &#8216;the gas tank was 5/8 full; the FL, FR, RL, and RR tires were measured to have 33, 33, 31, and 31 PSI; there were 8 CDs in the changer with the following titles: &#8230;; etc etc etc&#8217;.<br />
A &#8216;State Machine&#8217; is a name that is given to an object that has some number of finite states and performs transitions from one state to another state due to some condition. Without straying too far from strict definitions, the human body — as well as the brain<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/01/30/of-souls-and-state-machines/#footnote_0_22" id="identifier_0_22" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="&hellip; as reasonably posited by Alan Turing">1</a></sup> — can be considered to be state machines, like the automobile.<br />
In more complex state machines (like cars and humans), damage can be taken which doesn&#8217;t end the functioning of the machine but instead just prevents some of its states from being reached while in the damaged state:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a tire has gone flat, my car will not be able to reach the state in which it is moving 85 mph under its own propulsion</li>
<li>if i fracture all of the fingers on my right hand, i won&#8217;t be able to play the piano with my right hand</li>
</ul>
<p>The implied part of that sentence is that there is, of course, damage which is not mendable:</p>
<ul>
<li>that <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/lake/orl-crashpic20080126124231,0,3411244.photo" target="_new">obliterated BMW in Florida</a></li>
<li>significant brain damage in which large amounts of matter becomes unusable through either a wasting disease (like Alzheimer&#8217;s) or physical damage (like Phineas Gage and the rail spike)</li>
</ul>
<hr width="67%" />
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve gotten through that, for those that believe in a soul what the exact role that the soul plays in the human host tends to be varied, nebulous, and a bit fluffy; given this, i&#8217;ll avoid trying to corner that slippery pig and instead suggest that we look at two types of functions which the brain has been recognized to provide:<br />
<u>Event (and personal history) memory</u><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence that the formation, re-writing, and storage of the memory is performed in the brain is outstandingly documented — if in doubt, i&#8217;d invite the reader to start by listening to an episode devoted to this topic by the world&#8217;s best public radio program &#8211; <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/01/25" target="_new">Radio Lab</a>.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/01/30/of-souls-and-state-machines/#footnote_1_22" id="identifier_1_22" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Andrei Codrescu&rsquo;s [awful] spoken piece in this episode is thankfully an uncharacteristic addition to Radio Lab episodes.">2</a></sup> It could be argued that &#8216;object preference&#8217; is largely related to the memory function<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/01/30/of-souls-and-state-machines/#footnote_2_22" id="identifier_2_22" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Though the identical twin studies of Turecki and Rathus strongly suggest that there is a genetic component as well.">3</a></sup> since the repeated positive exposures to an object that would increase preference are likely instigated due to memory of previous positive exposure. (An analogue argument would be that an Alzheimer&#8217;s patient who forgets what their favourite food is, is unlikely to seek it out and will thereby cease manifestation of that preference.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both cases of a wasting disease, and of changed memories due to re-writes, there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that there is a secondary storehouse of the original information.<br />
<u>The amorphously defined &#8216;personality&#8217;</u><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While object preference plays a large role in defining the personality of a person, there are other factors which are brain based. Likelihood of aggressivity (which one might nudge gently into the larger group of &#8216;value system&#8217;), for example, has been shown to be related to brain architecture, and as well could be both apparently seen in the post-explosion version of Phineas, and is an all too frequent occurrence in Alzheimer&#8217;s patients.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s common in these is that the biological brain matter is the storehouse for these things, for were it some other object (such as a soul), it would be expected that the functions would still exist despite the destruction of the grey and white matter. I suppose one could argue that a soul is a one way device while its host is living — in other words, that it is acting as purely a container of state — and after death could become transformed into an emitter of state as well. The poison misstep in that argument, though, is that it also argues that the soul has no contribution to a living human&#8217;s personality and value choices, which seems contrary to the described role of a soul in at least one or two major belief systems.</p>
<hr width="67%" />
<p>To boil that all down a bit, we have fairly compelling evidence that the biological lump we refer to as the brain is the actual container of the state descriptors which make up that person which we, and others, recognize us as. Since those qualities are manifestations of the underlying biological matter, after the physical cessation of a human host an attached hypothetical soul would have no semantic relation to that human host (or so little recognizable semantic commonality that two souls from hosts A and B would be unable to be ascribed to A or B in any of the ways that we, as living humans, identify unique individuals).<br />
Due to that, one has to ask what it means, what value it provides, to describe the human form as having an ethereal component when that ethereal component is forcibly divorced from nearly all of the qualities which make us, as humans, unique individuals.</p>
