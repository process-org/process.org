					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Ivan, it took quite a bit of research since I&#039;m focused on targeted cancer therapies.  Both Doug and I have our lawyers working on getting the company setup so we&#039;ll keep everyone informed.  I have a meeting with mine tomorrow morning (a good friend and brilliant mind).

If you can find articles discussing viral infection such as the one on NBC News this morning, and post a link to my article that would be helpful.  So far, with that type of action (and someone posting it to &quot;hacker news&quot; which was HUGE), a few thousand people have read it... and several people have offered to help, and two sent letters to the Gates Foundation.

I will keep doing what I&#039;m doing, but, as I mentioned, I don&#039;t care by whom it gets done... just that it gets done right and people&#039;s lives benefit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Hannon and Scott. I will definitely spread the word as much as I could. I read your article Scott. I thought it was wonderful. I had gone as far as writing the president about Dr. Riders work. No replies, off course. This is however not the time to give up. Let me know what else I can do.
