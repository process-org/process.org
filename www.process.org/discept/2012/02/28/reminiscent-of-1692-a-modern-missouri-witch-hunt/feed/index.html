					<description><![CDATA[As I recall from Psychology instruction, &quot;Michelle&quot; did garner a lot of attention. But again, as I remember it just didn&#039;t quite jive with me.

					<description><![CDATA[AlsoaSkepticinBatesCity -  I responded to your request via email.   Looking forward to hearing from you.  

I don&#039;t think any of the press has picked up on the significance of the events on February 17th.   This is probably due to the fact that only one newspaper reporter was in attendance.   Since no cameras were allowed in the courtroom, the television news concentrated only on events outside the courthouse - such as people walking to their cars.   

 Other than the oral arguments  from that hearing,  rest of the case specific information (from my 2010 article) was all taken from the same affidavits used by other  media at that time.   I simply chose to quote portions which the other media had ignored, and to fact check some of the claims.  

I found it interesting that when the cases first broke, many in the media reported Sheriff Alumbaugh stating, ‚ÄúAnybody that knows anything about child sex cases knows that exploitation of children is done quite a bit through the internet.‚Äù  Yet, none of these reporters noted the line from the search affidavit which explained that Burrell Mohler Sr. had never even set-up internet access on his computer.    In my mind, the two bits of information together would have made for more balanced reporting.  

I sincerely hope that you will be successful in getting some skepticism into the local press.   

Is it ironic or apropo that it&#039;s taken a blog in Massachusetts to expose a midwest witch-hunt?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obviously when Neomi Mattis explains away the conspicuous absence of evidence for her bizarre &amp; perverse conspiracy theory by stating ‚ÄúCultists include professionals, such as morticians and butchers, who are skilled at disposing of evidence,‚Äù the question for her becomes, what would it possibly take to dis-prove any cult abuse allegation? Of course, to the true believers, the very question must be very perplexing. Why would you want to dis-prove an allegation like that? Those allegations allow us to publicly discuss our twisted fantasies with the sanctimonious air of moral righteousness. It firmly embeds us in a comfortable world where one answer applies to every problem, while simultaneously insisting that those who reject this simplistic delusion are in &quot;denial&quot; of the reality of abuse.

The claim by Neomi Mattis that ‚Äú[The Perpetrators are also] dissociative and thus unaware of their other cult-involved selves‚Äù also begs the question of who or what is really in control -- according to this suspenseful plot-line -- when both the perpetrators AND the victims are acting as brain-washed automatons. This question, of course, brings us down the road to paranoid anti-Illuminism and Satanic cults managed by Satan himself. Unfortunately, alleged perpetrators have themselves been convinced that they were repressing their crimes under the influence of &quot;experts&quot; like Mattis. A well-known case of this was explored in the book &#039;Remembering Satan&#039; by Lawrence Wright regarding the Paul Ingram case. Ingram&#039;s daughter fell under the influence of Recovered Memory folly and accused her father Paul, who couldn&#039;t understand that his daughter could possibly be both not lying AND telling an utterly fictitious story. I sure it didn&#039;t help that Ingram belonged to Charismatic Church where notions of demonic possession are still taken seriously.

Another case in which it seems apparent that the accused swallowed the recovered memory Kool-Aid against their own best interests is told in a book called &#039;Hell Minus One&#039; by Anne A Johnson Davis. Davis is enough of fantasist that it is difficult to discern what is even supposed to be taken seriously in her book. Like Michelle Remembers, Davis describes supernatural visitations from a benevolent presence during her terror, though she doesn&#039;t cite Christ by name. Remember, in Michelle Remembers, &#039;Michelle&#039; was personally abused by Satan only to have her scars removed by Jesus H. himself. Davis doesn&#039;t go that far, but I did see her speak at a SMART conference, the final refuge of debunked conspiracy delusions, where the organizer, Neil Brick, recently reaffirmed his belief in the validity of Michelle Remembers (on the grounds that the emotional quality could not have been faked, and the publisher expressed that they did their due diligence before publishing it as a non-fiction book).

As I wrote of Davis&#039;s lecture following the conference: 

Davis did, in fact, recover her memories of satanic abuse during therapy.  At first her parents denied everything.  Deeply religious members of the Church of Latter Day Saints, Davis‚Äôs parents went to their minister claiming that Anne was ‚Äúhallucinating and possessed.‚Äù

The Church, it seems, was moved by Anne&#039;s story, sending three members of the clergy three separate times to Anne‚Äôs parent‚Äôs house in an attempt to extract confessions.  The duration of these visits is unknown, as is the nature of the discussions that took place.  &quot;These  [clergy]men were determined to get to the truth&quot;, according to Davis, &quot;They were greatly alarmed by the accusations.&quot;  On the third attempt, Davis relates in astonishment, ‚Äúthey confessed everything!‚Äù  Recognizing that a confession from her parents made little sense on their part, innocent or guilty, Davis can only imagine that they did so because they were ‚Äústupid‚Äù.

But confess they did, and these confessions were put into writing when Anne&#039;s mother and stepfather decided to write her letters of apology, taking responsibility for what they had allegedly done.  With these letters, Davis approached detectives acting on behalf of a then-operating Ritual Abuse Task Force in Utah.  Retired Lieutenant Detective Matt Jacobson of the Utah Attorney General&#039;s Office writes in the foreword to Davis&#039;s book, Hell Minus One, &quot;When Mike King, my AG detective partner, and I traveled to a state in the Pacific Northwest to question Anne&#039;s mother and stepfather about allegations of satanic ritual abuse, we found the contents of their confession letters to her to be true.  They confessed to us - in person.  The allegations were confirmed.&quot;

Despite these confessions, Davis decided not to press charges.  And this is where Davis&#039;s story becomes confusing.  Deciding that between Media slander and the FMSF (False Memory Syndrome Foundation), she‚Äôd ‚Äúnever get a fair judge and jury‚Äù, Davis opted ‚Äújust to get on with my life‚Äù.  

This is all well and good, but when doing talk tours promoting her book about the experience of satanic abuse, the idea that she decided not to press charges so as to just move on seems hardly credible.  And, again, when the question, why would they confess if they didn&#039;t do it? holds equal weight to the question, why would they confess even if they did do it? where are we left?  And how would the FMSF prevent her from receiving a fair trial?  Upon considering this, I realize that this comment only makes sense if Davis&#039;s mother and stepfather also recovered the memories of their own satanic cult involvement with which they &quot;corroborated&quot; Davis&#039;s claims.  

We find evidence of this in Davis&#039;s book. Davis publishes excerpts of her parents letters to her in which they confess to engaging in crimes of Satanic abuse. In these letters, we see lines like: &quot;Dear Anne: I now recognize the many terrible things that I did to you...&quot;
Dear Anne, I am going to write about what we have come up with about the incident in the trailer...&quot; (at which they describe sordid events that they apparently had newly &quot;come up with&quot;).
&quot;I must have suspected something bad had been done. I FEEL THAT I rationalized somehow [...]&quot; (emphasis mine).
Lucky for Anne, it seems her parents, though devoted Satanists, were still good Church-goers enough to accept the prodding of clergy to confess their repressed crimes.
In keeping with the non-vindictiveness that restrained her from pressing charges, Davis writes of her stepfather&#039;s death from colorectal cancer: 
&quot;The way I saw it, God had come through. The justice system could have never handled it as quickly and efficiently. How appropriate a cancer -- a consequence, for my stepfather -- after sodomizing me anally for years.&quot; 
The Lord does work in mysterious ways...]]></description>
