					<description><![CDATA[as a counterpoint, salvia seems to work best in a dark room with as little stimuli as possible.

and by &quot;best&quot; i really mean &quot;maximized&quot; as it is a largely an &quot;unfun&quot; experience. very interesting, to be sure, but especially once you get into extract blends, it straddles a line between &quot;a pervading sense of wrongness&quot; and &quot;insectoid dog-and-pony show&quot; with a side dash of short-term amnesia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As it is...

Excellent article. I would like to make a comparison to an experience I had while on Salvia Divinorum.

Salvia is a little different as it is a k-opiate blocker and the duration lasts not but 5 min. depending on how you take it. It is rumored through chewing about 28 leaves that it can last around half an hour.

Salvia still holds legal status as it is not classified as a contolled substance.

Enough of that legality intro jabber, lol.  I took my first hit outside on my porch watching the full-moon. I decided to start playing some psychic-T.V. to set a good mood(trip/reset).

After the first 2 hits, an overwhelming sense of joy hit me. It felt as if I was nature itself(considering im pantheist, thats probably why), and after the third a voice told me,&quot; Your doing it all wrong, let me help you.&quot; and i took another. Visuals started to kick in as the music slowed down. Everything was almost like water, waving to the rythm. enhancing my introspective thoughts.

I started to realize that I was listening to myself thinking and was aware of more thought processes than I usually notice, almost like the moment before doing something great, enhanced focus(if your into sharp-shooting its like that moment before you pull the trigger and everything comes to a stand-still, just to make that perfect shot.)

I came to the realization that I worry to much about material things(not literaly, I am very into nature and  such, but like money, work, etc...) I started to then think about what matters to me most. Family, fun, taking time for myself, etc...

I didnt experience the whole finger/toilet thing, lol, but I think there may be some similarities to what you have to say, or at least an anecdote.

Hope I could help or amuse the courious.

So be it...
