					<description><![CDATA[Well, the cone is really a subspace representation here - since we&#039;re talking about four-space/spacetime really, there&#039;s no way to get a good visual representation of something in that space and so a common trick is to drop a dimension. The cone in this case is really two spatial dimensions and one time dimension; imagine the finest smallest dot on your floor; now imagine in the next second, the dot floats to 1 cm above the floor, while growing constantly to become a disc 1 cm across; now imagine that over the next second, it continues to float 1 cm higher, the disc constantly growing to be now 2 cm across. If you can envision that entire process as a blur in front of you, like a photo with the shutter held open for 2 seconds, what you would see is a cone.

(As a thought experiment, imagine the point becoming an orb, not a disc, which grows with time - how that would look in a photo with shutter length of, say, 5 seconds)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ok, so I&#039;ve skimmed this twice, read it slowly in between both skims, and found the idea missing in a crucial point of &#039;how&#039;?
the analogy of a cone dynamic can be a quasi-mystical / scientific construct if used as a meta-phor what?

Or rather, how? Why I comment is that this is the middle of a whole discourse which I haven&#039;t read yet. I am sure that there is a philosophical backdrop I&#039;m missing here.

Movement of information is a measurable effigy? I would hazard that quantum mechanics would also imply that the information would exhibit dynamics beyond a cone as information becomes a wave when many believe mythos and hearsay, and particles..well they are points from which any angle the light is seen. That could be a scientific discovery which =true now matter how many times you reproduce it, or the innate cliche that is many a pyschodrama.
But given that you said we don&#039;t transmit/receive in light speed, then I prefer an osmotic/liquid view whereby currents (and waves) and this time particulate, are carried.
And then there is sublimation.
Please expand. Or at least give links.]]></description>
