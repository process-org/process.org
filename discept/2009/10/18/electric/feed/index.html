					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link. More Ah means more power (6.4 Ah to 8Ah)? Does that translate to speed or just battery range? How high Ah can I go? Also, any way to increase speed?

Thanks,
Dave]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a article regarding the Giant Lite and how to replace the battery core. It&#039;s really not that complicated and can be accomplished in under an hour.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have been looking all over for a post like yours regarding the Giant Lite. I am about to purchase one at a great price but I am sure I will need a new battery soon. Could you send me the guide to re-cell the bike with higher capacity batteries and also how to increase the speed. This is my first foray into e-bikes and after a long search for something someone needs to get rid of the Giant Lite. I am excited to start of with a classic, from what I hear and read. Thanks for your help. Dave]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure how long ago this post is from...  I am NOT a techie, but do own the Giant Lite. I love the bike, but now have a battery whose life is over!  I am anxious to get a new one, but don&#039;t want to spend $400 to get one from Giant. The link you included to the battery site looks promising, but it is not clear to me which battery to buy and whether a  non-techie could complete the replacement. Can you help?  David]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am anxious to be making one of these with my next tax return, that is if inflation doesnt rise by %400. (as said by Glenn Beck on Fox News) Either way I will still be making one. 

I tend not to pay much attention to the news, but if what is true about this whole &#039;Global Treaty&#039; to be considered in 3-5 weeks, then it would a smart time start to consider more &#039;underground&#039; solutions to the way society normally does things. 

My Goal for the next few years, depending on resources;  to be building a self sustainable house off the grid. DIY or DIE.]]></description>
