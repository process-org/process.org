					<description><![CDATA[Comfort tortures himself through faith and doctrines not even proved to be valid; straying from instinct and applying himself less to the benefits of others, as it seems. To bring up another point, by saying that the taste of a banana is pleasing to the taste buds is too generalized a statement, as not everyone enjoys the taste of the fruit, and as some are even allergic to it. Another example of ignorance perpetuated by fear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He has a certain charm doesn&#039;t he? He reads like he is constantly interrupting, getting his point across, or making sure that the Bible gets sold. 
How about a discussion about the book that was verbally propagated for many years, is missing stories (the apocrypha - decided by men that the stories were unsuitable for the masses), and they even got the hero&#039;s name wrong in the 2nd half - he was called Joshua.

Imagineers. Love &#039;em. even the ones that use common sense...and what is common sense? It presupposes much, and is a great pitch to keep selling those books. Almost turning the discourse between the atheist and the christian into a class war.]]></description>
