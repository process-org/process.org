				Comment on Mass Hallucination, Hysteria &#038; Miracles by olddesertrat				</title>

					<description><![CDATA[While I agree with your final conclusion that mass hallucination is a bullshit argument,  get the impression that you are claiming that it is the non-scientific supporters making the false claim that mass hallucination is the scientific explanation.
  I am 54 yrs old.  From my live experience this is absolutely NOT the case.  Can not think of a single time any non-scientific person claimed mass hallucination was the scientific explanation.
  Have had dozens of discussions of about mass hallucination.  Every person I have ever talked that used the mass hallucination theory viewed themselves as the scientific, reasonable and informed side.
   My educational background is theoretical physics.  Am very far biased to reason and logic.  However mass hallucination theory has always appeared to me to be itself a irrational belief disguised as science.   Mass hallucination can not be explained, it can not be reproduced, it has not been documented to even exist.
  Example:   100 people in a football field claim to see a 300 ft disk shaped UFO with blinking lights.  Two news teams show up.  News teams point their time-stamped cameras at the sky were UFO is suppose to be...and see nothing.  Other time stamped cameras point at crowed pointing at sky, talking about seeing UFO.
   IF this happened, then I would agree it is a documented case of mass hallucination existing.
  HOWEVER....to my knowledge this or similiar has NEVER happened.
If 100 people claim to see religious statues move...If there are no cameras there documenting that statues did not move...there exists no evidence that event did not happen.  Eye witness accounts is all the exist.  To simply discredit and dismiss eye witnesses without any other proof or evidence is itself a biased and irrational act.
  Again, as a scientist,  I am personally more inclined to believe that maybe there was an earth quake smaller than human perception that set up oscillating waves of motion in the statues
  However...that would be my belief...NOT PROOF, NOT EVIDENCE.   If I have no scientific backup proof or evidence for my theory, or belief or opinion on what happened to those statues...then my belief of what happened so no better than the religious person&#039;s belief in what happened.  Claiming my belief is &quot;better&quot; is itself a delusion.  Exactly like using mass hallucination as a &quot;better&quot; explanation.]]></description>
