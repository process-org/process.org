					<description><![CDATA[Someone should hand a &quot;Rodney King&quot; over to the terrorist groups.
Seems like every WW3 story I ever read had everyone dead at the end.
Seems I couldn&#039;t fit in with any of these groups as I am two eccentric.
So far I&#039;m following the Helter Skelter Model.
Select Part Five From Boyd Rice Debates Bob Larson 4 my best advice .
Seeing how I am religious , I have even more adventurous ideas than that.
So, Boyd does mention letting the system give itself a good workout.
Supposing that&#039;s what this person would probably guess the clever are doing.
Something like the Ultimate Fighting Championship, gone really, really wrong.
Summed up to say,  not adverse to self-defense, yet it can be most dangerous.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;As a bigger picture, it all continues to make little sense.&quot;

imagine an animal with thousands of arms.

now imagine that animal running a bureaucracy.

now imagine this animal has to justify its existence to get more money each year.

the animal with a thousand arms will make a lot of promises it can&#039;t keep, and say a lot of things that don&#039;t make sense, taken as a whole.

did i mention the animal is at war with itself?

anyway, i think it makes perfect sense, but my expectations of government action, licit and illicit, are as impossibly low as the expectations of many voters was impossibly high.

the single best bit of this past election was both chocolate jesus and captain foreverwar promising that no one would ever lose money on their homes, like, ever and forever. LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/potentialfordisaster/s_69664.html

In 2002, Pittsburgh reporter Carl Prine investigated the security provided to chemical plants and railways.  I saw this televised on PBS, and if I remember correctly, he made a sticker that read &quot;This Could Be A Bomb&quot;, stuck it on the side of a chemical tanker car outside the plant, and followed the train on its course.  His sticker made it, undiscovered, all the way to the train&#039;s destination.

This rather long, dry report has a spooky photo in it: a railway tanker car with the words &quot;Chlorine - Inhalation Hazard&quot; parked 4 blocks from the U.S. Capitol Building.  The report also mentions Mr. Prine.

It&#039;s really disturbing that the &quot;official government reports&quot; seem to be so glibly speaking out both sides of their mouths about an issue as important as national security.]]></description>
