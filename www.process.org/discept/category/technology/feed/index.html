								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">In<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022572"> a paper</a> published 27 July [1], researchers from MIT reported successful tests in mice with a new drug that holds the promise of being a cure to<em> all </em>viruses. The drug, DRACO (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>ouble-stranded <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R</span>NA <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ctivated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>aspase <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span>ligomerizer), works as a &#8220;broad-spectrum&#8221; antiviral, killing virus-hijacked cells by targeting double-stranded RNA produced in the viral replication process. DRACO proved successful against all 15 viruses tested &#8220;including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, H1N1 influenza, a stomach virus, a polio virus, dengue fever and several other types of hemorrhagic fever.&#8221; [2]<span id="more-841"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We may expect results from cell trials against AIDS within the next 12 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">DRACO is but one broad-spectrum therapeutic being developed as part of a project called PANACEA (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>harmacological <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ugmentation of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span>onspecific <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>nti-pathogen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>ellular <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>nzymes and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span>ctivities) headed by Dr. Todd Rider, senior staff scientist in MIT Lincoln Laboratory&#8217;s Chemical, Biological, and Nanoscale Technologies Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I met with Dr. Rider in the food court of the MIT co-op bookstore early on a weekday. He had already finished tending to his mice and, after we chatted, he rose to declare that he was off to do &#8220;<em>real</em> work&#8221;&#8230; writing grant proposals to keep his research alive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Could you give us a broad overview of the Panacea project?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We&#8217;ve come up with a broad-spectrum antiviral that we call DRACO, Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizer (I love acronyms), and it&#8217;s basically designed to detect any long double stranded RNA, so we&#8217;ve created chimeric proteins where one end will detect the chimeric RNA &#8212; the double-stranded RNA &#8212; and then the other end will trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide. So the net effect is that these DRACO molecules can go inside all the cells in your body, or at this moment, inside all the cells in a mouse, and if they don&#8217;t find anything, then they don&#8217;t do anything. But if they find a viral infection, if they find a viral double-stranded RNA, then that will activate the back ends to trigger cell suicide, and that will kill the infected cell. That terminates the infection.</p>
<p><strong>So there wouldn&#8217;t be a difference between DNA Viruses and RNA Viruses?</strong></p>
<p>It works with both. We&#8217;ve tested it on both. All known viruses make double-stranded RNA, and that&#8217;s true from the literature and also true from our experiments. So here (indicating illustration) the viruses we tested included a couple DNA viruses, and it worked quite nicely against those. Others in the literature are also known to make quite a bit of double-stranded RNA. Other DNA viruses, like pox viruses and herpes viruses, also make double-stranded RNA.</p>
<p><strong>Has it been tested on each family of virus?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been tested on these families of viruses so far (indicating paper). There are a gazillion viruses, so we&#8217;re working our way through them as quickly as we can. It&#8217;s been tested on several very different families so far.</p>
<p><strong>My understanding is that viruses usually kill the cell anyway, but retroviruses usually do not. I don&#8217;t know how viruses cluster. Are there any odds at all that there would be a retrovirus that clusters too tightly in a certain organ where it [triggered cell death by DRACO] would cause a lesion?</strong></p>
<p>Virtually <em>all</em> viruses will kill the host cell on the way out. Of the hand-full that don&#8217;t, your own immune system will try to kill those infected cells. So we&#8217;re really not killing any more cells with our appraoch than we already have been. It&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re killing them at an early enough stage before they infect and ultimately kill more cells. So if anything this limits the amount of cell death.</p>
<p><strong>So that&#8217;s not really a legitimate fear.</strong></p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p><strong>How far along are you and how far away are you from human trials?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately quite a long way. We&#8217;ve done a number of tests in mice. We need to do more testing in mice. Of course, MIT is not a pharmaceutical company. There&#8217;s only so far we can take it at MIT. We&#8217;re hoping to license it to some pharmaceutical company, and they would carry to larger-scale animal trials. Usually the FDA wants to see a lot of mouse trials, which we&#8217;ve done already; and then a lot of trials in, say, rabbits or guinea pigs, and then trials in monkeys before they approve human trials. So, if a licensee takes this, if we have funding for it, it still might take a decade or so before it really is available for humans.</p>
<p><strong>So how&#8217;s the funding working now?</strong></p>
<p>We have funding from NIH [National Institutes of Health].</p>
<p><strong>And can you take it up to monkey here [at MIT]?</strong></p>
<p>We may be able to take it into further animal models here, but mice are the easiest thing to use. We have a lot of mice. We&#8217;re also limited by funding. We only haved NIH funding at the moment, and we only have enough funding for about 1 person, and we have 4 people total, counting me, working at the moment, so we&#8217;ve split the funding four different ways&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Has anybody reached out to you?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. Not so far.</p>
<p><strong>When I first read about this I thought this was an amazing story, that this would be front-page news in a couple of hours. Weeks later, I was thinking this must not have been a true story. That&#8217;s when I looked it up again and saw that it was indeed on the MIT site. What&#8217;s the relative lack of interest. There haved been articles, but I feel this is definitely front-page material.</strong></p>
<p>Well thank you. On the funding front, I think there&#8217;s a ton of funding for very basic research &#8212; not applied research, trying to cure something, but basic research &#8212; Let&#8217;s go study this virus, see how this virus works in a little more detail. There&#8217;s a ton of NIH funding for that. On the applied front, if you are ready for human trials &#8212; so you&#8217;re 10 years more advanced than we are now &#8212; then there are government agencies and companies that will take it and take it to that final step. But in that long gap in between there&#8217;s very very little funding out there. So we&#8217;ve been struggling for all of 11 years now just working to get funding, and at the moment we&#8217;re just barely limping along.</p>
<p><strong>This is a subset of PANACEA, right? Can you describe PANACEA?</strong></p>
<p>PANACEA is a family of broad-spectrum anti-pathogen treatments. We&#8217;ve tested some others, we&#8217;ve tried to get funding for others. This [DRACO] is the one that is furthest along.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the others that look promising?</strong></p>
<p>We have a number of others. [DRACO] is a broad-spectrum antiviral. We have other broad-spectrum antivirals. We also have other PANACEA treatments that we&#8217;ve adapted to go after other things. Like for bacteria. And of course there are antibiotics, but for bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics, such as tuberculosis, malaria&#8230; so we can adapt this to pathogens other than viruses. We&#8217;ve done some initial experiments, we just can&#8217;t get funding for that so far.</p>
<p><strong>Do you foresee any potential wild-cards in the human trials?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always difficult to tell what will happen. I hope that there won&#8217;t be. We&#8217;re always concerned that there will be some toxicity or other unforeseen problems. We&#8217;ve been very pleased every step of the way in the cell testing. We&#8217;ve tested in a number of different human cell types representing many different organs; human lung cells, human liver cells, all kinds of different human cells, as well as a variety of animal cells. We haven&#8217;t seen any toxicity or any other strange effects in any of those cell types. In the mice we were again very concerned about toxicity, and we haven&#8217;t seen any toxicity in the mice. We inject the mice with very high doses of the stuff daily for a number of days, and they seem fine. We let them move for a while, eventually we dissected them, looked at the tissues. All the tissues were fine, there&#8217;s no organ damage or anything. It&#8217;s always possible something unexpected could come up further down the road in monkies or in humans. We certainly hope not. But I think there is enough flexibility in the concept that even if there were a problem, there are ways to redesign the constructs that we have to overcome any potential problems.</p>
<p><strong>That might also speak to the production cost. Is it fairly low production cost if, say, it was to be mass-produced in the future?</strong></p>
<p>These are produced in bacteria, and at the moment I really don&#8217;t know what the ultimate production cost would be. We produce on a very small scale, barely enough for our mice. Of course cells eat a lot less DRACO than mice do. So if we&#8217;re producing for cells, that&#8217;s a very small quantity, but just a few flasks of bacteria will produce enough to last us for a while. But once you scale this up to a large-scale production large-scale animal trials or human trials, hopefully the cost would go down. I don&#8217;t know exactly what the cost would be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you envision the final end-plan to be people with DRACO in their medicine cabinet, or more like penicillin today?</strong></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s safe I&#8217;d like to see it used as much as possible for as many different things as possible. I would guess that if it were approved for human use by the FDA, initially they would be conservative enough that they would only want to see it used in very dire cases, just in case there are interesting side-effects or something, and it&#8217;s only to people with ebola or HIV that&#8217;s become resistant to other drugs who would get this. If this proved to be safe in those cases, then I would hope that they&#8217;d approve it for wider use against more common pathogens, perhaps all the way down to the common cold. And if it really is safe, then maybe you&#8217;d just pop a DRACO pill any time you felt a cold coming on.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it stay in the system? It&#8217;s obviously not a vaccine &#8212;</strong></p>
<p>Right. In cells it lasts at least for a couple of weeks, possibly longer. In the mice it lasts for at least 2 days. We have a lot of data in the paper showing it will persist in mice for at least 48 hours at fairly high doses in the tissues. This is really about trying to optimize that. There are a lot of tricks we can use to try to make it last longer if necessary. And if this stuff is truly completely safe, then you can give it prophylactically. You could even concievably give someone the gene for the DRACO so that their cells would just permanently produce the DRACO, and they would naturally be resistant to almost everything.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, wow. That&#8217;s an amazing idea.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>I feel like this is something that should be fast-tracked. We have all this planning in regards to epidemics. There is all kinds of scare that we&#8217;re ripe for an epidemic.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps we will be [approached with funding offers] in the future, but so far we haven&#8217;t been. We&#8217;ve really struggled along for the past 11 years, barely getting enough funding to stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>So this has been on the table, at least as an idea, for 11 years?</strong></p>
<p>Right. We just got good data from the mouse trials and published that, but 11 years ago we started engineering the DRACOs. Genetic engineering was a bit more primative in those days, so it took us a while to actually produce these things. Then it took us a while to produce and test them in cells. We ultimately tested against 15 different viruses in cells. As I said, we were kind of limping along for funding for much of that time, so we could only work on it when we had funding to work on it. For some fraction of our time, we had funding to work on it. Eventually, we were able to test against the 15 different viruses in cells in 11 different cell types. And then we had funding to do some mouse trials, got data, and then we got published.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a cold this winter&#8230; are you going to be tempted?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not tempted by colds. I&#8217;ve had very bad stomach viruses and I&#8217;ve been tempted to give myself the stuff to see what would happen.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll do that, though?</strong></p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be enough anyway. We only produce enough for mice, and for a human you require a much larger dose than for a 20 gram mouse.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a recent trip to mainland China I spent most of my time in a city called <a title="Hangzhou" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou" target="_blank">Hangzhou</a>. The population of this beautiful city is somewhere around 3 million souls. A lot of Chinese people rely on the bicycle for transport as well as scooters. Chinese cities are very congested like their Euro counterparts so two wheeled transport makes sense on pretty much every level (except perhaps safety). But in China there is one difference that is glaringly obvious. Although the roads are packed, and I do mean packed with scooter pilots, the streets are quiet. The reason for this? It&#8217;s because 99% of the scooters are electric.  It&#8217;s quite surreal. It appears to the foreigner like a movie missing a quintessential piece of the sound track. Now here&#8217;s another interesting statistic, around a third of all Chinese bicycles are also electric mopeds or have electric assist. I&#8217;ve also witnessed this phenomenon in Japan where e-bikes and scooters are ubiquitous.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1904334,00.html?iid=digg_share">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1904334,00.html?iid=digg_share</a></p>
<p>This is all very interesting to me because I ride an electric bike and it&#8217;s made in China.</p>
<p><span id="more-464"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_467" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-467" class="size-medium wp-image-467" title="giant" src="http://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-300x225.jpg" alt="Giant Lite with Extracycle extension" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.process.org/discept/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/giant.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-467" class="wp-caption-text">Giant Lite with Extracycle extension</p></div>
<p>I originally built this bike as a camera car. I was shooting the Marathon de Medoc in Bordeaux and wanted to shoot the host of my show in amongst the marathon runners. This is strictly forbidden for motor vehicles but my production manager talked the race organizers into allowing a bicycle on the course. So I built this Giant electric with an <a title="Xtracycle" href="http://www.xtracycle.com/">Xtracycle</a> back end. The bike carried a rider, myself and all of our camera and sound gear for the whole marathon, just under 400 pounds or 200kg. I was sold. When i returned home with the bike it pretty much replaced my car and keep in mind that I live in Los Angeles. My Giant with two batteries has a range of about 60miles and a top (assisted) speed of about 28mph. It can easily carry two people and a weeks worth of groceries. The bike all in cost me around 2,500 USD. Of course the bike uses a bit of generated energy but according to what I&#8217;ve read (sorry no footnotes) it works out to over 800 mpg. If you are really industrious you could invest another $600 in a rooftop solar kit and your bike would be completely off the grid.</p>
<p>I find it kind of astounding that the electric bike or electric scooters haven&#8217;t become popular in North America. I think it&#8217;s partially due to the fact that electric vehicles are not considered to be a practical form of transportation here. An affordable electric car is definitely a ways off (unless you have 90k burning a hole in your pocket to buy a <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Roadster</a>&#8230;drool). But here&#8217;s the thing, electric bike technology is totally capable of providing us with low cost zero emission transport right now. Especially for those of us who live in warmer climates. The only thing that&#8217;s really holding back the manufactures of e-bikes are the laws governing the bikes themselves. Most countries require that the top speed of any assisted bicycle be around 17-19mph. I think that&#8217;s ridiculous considering the fact that anyone in reasonably good shape can pedal a normal road bike a lot faster than that. Now, I&#8217;m not suggesting that legislation should allow unlicensed e-bikes an unlimited top speed, but something closer to 30 mph would be more reasonable and way more practical. That&#8217;s about as fast as your average rider would want to go on a bike anyway and is a totally reasonable speed for urban transport. Fortunately there are ways around these limitations and that&#8217;s what this article is about. Hacking the electric bike!</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>O.K. This is the part where I need to cover my ass. During the course of this article I may be giving you advice that would allow you to make or build your e-bike in such a way that it may go faster than your local laws allow. If you do this and have some kind of horrifying accident where you are dismembered, maimed or in anyway injured. Don&#8217;t come crying to me. Also if you are not completely comfortable on a normal bicycle, I would not recommend going this route first. Buy a nice slow stock e bike and ride it until you&#8217;re really ready to speed things up a bit.</em></p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that any bike can be made electric and it&#8217;s not a difficult process if you are using a ready made kit. I would argue that an e-bike that you construct for yourself will not only be a far superior ride in terms of stability and speed, but way cooler. Off the rack e-bikes are dork-mobiles for the most part, and those that aren&#8217;t are far too expensive for the level of performance they deliver.</p>
<p>O.K. Step one <strong>HACKING THE GIANT LITE</strong></p>
<p>The Giant Lite was by far the best e bike built in it&#8217;s time. It still stands up pretty well next to what&#8217;s out there right now. Granted the motor at 350 watts is a bit underpowered but on the whole it&#8217;s one of the lightest and most efficient off the rack bikes that has ever been made. You can still find new ones on line and they usually about USD $1000. Which is a STEAL compared to other off the rack e-bikes bike out their today.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to try a mod like mine try to find a step through model. The step through makes more sense if your going to extend the back end and make it a two seater. Throwing your leg over the back of a bike that&#8217;s 7 feet long isn&#8217;t so easy. Also I think the step through model is easier to find.</p>
<p>If you are truly in need of step by step advice on how to covert a Giant Lite to a faster viable urban transporter then send me an email and I&#8217;ll send you detailed instructions. I&#8217;m not going to post them here. I&#8217;ve had great success with this bike but I think there are better and cheaper alternatives that have developed since I built it. There are some links to said alternatives at the end of this article.</p>
<p><strong>Batteries:</strong></p>
<p>The Giant uses NiMh batteries and like all rechargeables, they have a finite life-span. The good news is they are easy and inexpensive to refurbish. The even better news is that when you refurbish your batteries you can buy new ones that have a higher storage capacity and will give you more range. The process of upgrading your batteries is called re-celling them. You can buy the kits on-line. The original battery packs for the Giant are around $400. The re-cell kits are half that price.</p>
<p>For any other kit avoid old school led acid batteries. They are cheap, but can&#8217;t be recycled and have a very poor power to weight ratio. There is a good on-line distributor for battery tech:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.batteryspace.com/?SSAID=297581">http://www.batteryspace.com/?SSAID=297581</a></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently investigating LifePO4 batteries as the power source for my next bike. Lithium seems to be the way to go now.</p>
<p>Currently I think the best and also the easiest option is to go with a high output hub motor combined with some advanced battery technology. Just make sure you match the battery voltage to the motor your are powering. Most e-bike systems are either 24 or 36 volt technology. Hub motors can be configured to drive either the front or rear wheel and can be fitted to pretty much any standard bike.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about the internet is that it brings people together.</p>
<p>One of the unbelievably awful things about the internet is that it mates that &#8216;bringing together of people&#8217; with the double curse of the average human: (1) the difficulty to discriminate in choice and (2) the propensity to hoard and believe that more is better. What results from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_(1986_film)" target=_new>Fly</a> like merging is lived out daily by tens of millions on sites like Facebook. Multiplying the penalty of living this out on such sites is that, unlike some night in 1992 that faded out to muted shades as time went by, massive farms of servers are busy replicating and archiving your mistakes right now, so that the future you, the future friends, the future employers, perhaps the future children, can see it as clearly as though it just happened.</p>
<p>Welcome to the end of valuable friendships: a modern tragic play in four parts. <span id="more-306"></span></p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act I</b><br />
<em>Your friend&#8217;s friend is a two-dimensional fuckwit</em></center><br />
</p>
<p>Looking back, there were those things said in passing over dinner, and the odd second hand tale. It seems like the clues were always there, waiting to be assembled: your dear friend has some good friends who are real douche bags; they haven&#8217;t a cupful of wit nor a minute ember of humor to douse with it. You always suspected it but you could never <em>prove it</em> &mdash; until now. Day in and day out, your friend&#8217;s update feed becomes a longer and longer laundry list of unfunny non-insights and retorts which weren&#8217;t even amusing when they first became public domain in the 1980s.<br />
You can no longer deny it: here are the buffoons willingly added, and continuing to be kept, by your friend as their friends&hellip; and they&#8217;re schmucks: screamingly obvious, self-promoting, flying-a-flag morons. Your mind races:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:18px;">
<li>How does this person who i&#8217;ve come to hold in high esteem have such lousy taste?</li>
<li>What does it mean for my own self-worth to be a friend of someone who has such lousy taste?</li>
</ul>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act II</b><br />
<em>A hole that can never be filled</em><br />
</p>
<p>20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and on and on; and more and more&hellip; Like <em>Romeo is Bleeding</em>, your friend has to fill that hole, but instead of cash in the backyard, they can&#8217;t stay away from that Add button. It becomes a tired, hackneyed, ritual which has lost nearly all value and thereby has cheapened that for which it once had value. Nobody has 150 friends. Simply nobody. You can&#8217;t say for sure that you&#8217;ve even had meaningful conversations with 150 different people in your entire adult life&hellip; but there it sits: your friend&#8217;s &#8220;friend&#8221; list. What does it even mean? Even making the statement that someone has 200 friends would have been vapid braggadocio in recent times, and yet here it is as some item of pride on the front page of your-friend-the-prom-queen&#8217;s profile. And still everyday, there&#8217;s a new one, a new five. Where do they keep finding them? How many items can a collector really pay loving attention to?</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act III</b><br />
<em>Tear Down This Wall! <span style="font-size:smaller;">(even if it&#8217;s supporting the roof)</span></em></center><br />
</p>
<p>Five years ago, the idea of an adult hanging out frequently with both their parents and peers in a social situation would have been solely the hallmark of the tacky white trash.</p>
<p>Five years ago, the idea of a barely known co-worker and a friend-for-the-past-fifteen-years together regularly sharing your conversation and comment would have been impossible &mdash; obviously fucking wrong.</p>
<p>Today, these are part of life-de-facto on social network sites like Facebook. Evaporating is the concept of &#8216;appropriateness&#8217;. Bob, from human resources, three jobs ago, is treated to seeing your friend&#8217;s children photos &#8211; just like you are. Your friend commenting on Brenda&#8217;s photo of her baby is given the same profile screen real estate as anything else your friend does, even though you don&#8217;t know who in the world Brenda is and couldn&#8217;t give a good god damn. On your friend&#8217;s profile, you can read your half of the conversation your friend had with their parent when (a) why is it the public&#8217;s business, and (b) you didn&#8217;t want to know, and (c) seeing only half of something not only makes no sense, but also inspires curiosity in something you didn&#8217;t want to know to begin with.</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Act IV</b><br />
<em>Everyone is a King or Queen</em></center><br />
</p>
<p>&hellip; so, much like all of the want-to-be-somebodies who flocked daily to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles" target=_new>Versailles</a> in the 1700s to stay in favour, you too get up every morning to attend your friend&#8217;s court. What is it today that might be proclaimed to that court of those awaiting hundreds of friends &mdash; that passing remark that you&#8217;d like to be a part of because they are, after all, still your friend.<br />
Dirtied and devalued is the notion of privacy: the transience of a special shared moment, lost to archiving on third party servers and replicated; backed up databases; off-site-stored media; there, always stark, never going away; often available for others to read, weeks, months, and years later, and best of-all: out of context. This is a dark rabbit hole from which there&#8217;s no return.</p>
<hr width="33%"/>
<center><b>Epilogue</b></center><br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps this is just the way humans will evolve, like birds in a pet store, we will become all a large mishmash of people twittering-posting-and-otherwise-babbling, simultaneously, en masse, about nothing of any particular importance. Perhaps that will become what is usual and regular. It&#8217;s too early to tell.</p>
<p>One thing seems for certain: it cheapens us all.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Updated:</b> 13.dec.2008; article appended</p>
<p>The world population has a subset comprised of people who, for one reason or another, demonstrate an online desire to constructively expand and, at least in their view, build a better society around them; this phenomenon is repeatedly demonstrated through public knowledge repositories such as those backed by a wiki format. Concurrently, 2008 draws to a close with live web presence being broadcast in increasingly better quality, and with content of every day slice-of-life views. <span id="more-72"></span></p>
<p>Using the editors of Wikipedia as an example, we can see that there is a core of people<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/12/08/2009-prediction-extended-neighborhood-watch-nabs-criminals/#footnote_0_72" id="identifier_0_72" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="the Huggle whitelist lists over 30,000 editors, for example">1</a></sup> spread around the world who patrol the encyclopedic content watching for forms of vandalism and misinformation. It does not seem outrageous to claim that this behavior satisfies something within individual editors which is akin to the fulfillment of justice and the maintenance of a world view. Similarly, it is unlikely that, for the majority of these individuals, there is something peculiar to encyclopedic bodies which restricts this desire; instead, it is reasonable that this motivating desire could be applied to other arenas were they available.</p>
<p>The other ingredient to this cake, web cams, have had sort of a milk-jug-being-slid-across-the-kitchen-counter existence. Historically, development would occur to a certain resolution quality which was bounded by how much data could be transmitted upstream, during which relative-lull widely available upstream capabilities would surge ahead; rinse and repeat. At present, the quality of web cam broadcasts, thanks to both increasing resolution of cheaper cameras and the decreasing cost for wider upstream bandwidth, has become quite good. Getting an amount of general media exposure recently, there are two good quality example streams from the Tenderloin in San Francisco<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/12/08/2009-prediction-extended-neighborhood-watch-nabs-criminals/#footnote_1_72" id="identifier_1_72" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="simply the best city in the world">2</a></sup> at <a href="http://www.adamsblock.com/" target="_new">&#8220;Adam&#8217;s Block&#8221;</a><sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/12/08/2009-prediction-extended-neighborhood-watch-nabs-criminals/#footnote_2_72" id="identifier_2_72" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="for those not familiar with the Tenderloin, it&rsquo;s one of the more squalid neighborhoods in San Francisco; so, the likelihood of witnessing something dodgy from the stream is decent">3</a></sup> — we&#8217;re not at the quality of license plate resolution at this distance, but it is generally sharp and with a spry frame rate.</p>
<p>So we have a world population of desktop vigilantes and an increasing population of good quality live web broadcasts of slice-of-life happenings. Further, thanks to the world-wide nature of the internet, observation can occur continually, 24 hours per day, without any one observer needing to perturb their sleep nor social schedule. The last, minimal and non-essential, ingredient would be an even easier way to contact law enforcement local to the geographical area for the camera feed. All of which leads to the prediction that 2009 will see criminal activity being reported by geographically truly remote observers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>As a preface: this article shouldn&#8217;t be mistaken as me being wistful for terrorist actions; i am ~infinitely more glad to have the lack of terrorist activity in the geographical places i love than i am pained by yet something else not making sense in the world.</i></p>
<p>As much as i would wish quietude on my thought processes and to simply enjoy the silence, there is something nagging which i&#8217;m unable to shake: there&#8217;s something suspicious concerning the state of terrorist attacks in the US and in Europe &mdash; an equation which doesn&#8217;t appear to add up when written out. <span id="more-59"></span></p>
<p>There are certain terrorist groups which advertise themselves as being quite angry at the US and at European countries; voluminous rhetoric in written, aural and visual form is easily encountered on the internet, for example. Judging from their widespread messages, as well as their claimed actual acts: these same groups don&#8217;t appear to be of lazy people, nor people without financial means, nor people without access to instruments of destruction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US and Europe, the public face on anti-terrorism efforts seemingly verges on buffoonery; whether it be employing rules after the fact<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/10/31/an-incongruent-state-of-terrorism/#footnote_0_59" id="identifier_0_59" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="From training the stink eye on shoes only after someone tried to blow their&rsquo;s up, to banning a very arbitrary amount of fluid only after it was found that people had nefarious plans that employed fluids, and so forth.">1</a></sup>, or instituting policies largely ineffectual in capturing people of forethought<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/10/31/an-incongruent-state-of-terrorism/#footnote_1_59" id="identifier_1_59" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Such as confiscating media storage devices at borders, when any person serious about getting terrorist data (i don&rsquo;t even know what this would be) into a country would simply put said data on an internet connected server and then walk physically-empty-handed into the country.">2</a></sup>, the resulting impression is of a force by which no determined person of moderate intelligence could be deterred.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/10/31/an-incongruent-state-of-terrorism/#footnote_2_59" id="identifier_2_59" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For further reading: Bruce Schneier has written and spoken extensively about the logically inconsistent, and unsafe, policies instituted by the TSA in the US.">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to force in numbers at organized country entry points, there exist the tremendously permeable land and sea borders. Historically, these haven&#8217;t succeeded as obstacles to traffickers of humans/drugs/cigarettes/alcohol/&hellip;; if any given country can&#8217;t stop these traffickers at its borders, then there&#8217;s very little reason to believe that these same borders aren&#8217;t porous to any other type of arriving party.</p>
<p>So, we have angry groups of people already displaying a propensity towards violent acts against certain other peoples; at the same time these other peoples both live in a very travel-open space and display Clouseau-esque defense postures. And yet: there have been basically no terrorist attacks in these countries over the past 7 years.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/10/31/an-incongruent-state-of-terrorism/#footnote_3_59" id="identifier_3_59" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize the impact the London and Madrid attacks have had on the lives of people, but if we were to spin some custom metric of unit &lsquo;(potential-area)(person)/(time)&rsquo;, it would be damn small.">4</a></sup></p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on with this apparent imbalance? It could be that the advertised ineptitude is simply a ruse engineered by what is actually a very savvy and wired-in intelligence community, though continued policy decisions in other branches<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2008/10/31/an-incongruent-state-of-terrorism/#footnote_4_59" id="identifier_4_59" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For example, choosing a bizarre moral stance over security as a national policy.">5</a></sup> would have to mean that the ruse is a coordinated effort across several generally notoriously independent government offices.</p>
<p>As a bigger picture, it all continues to make little sense.</p>

<p><em>Alice appears on The Process for the first time&#8230; </em><span id="more-35"></span></p>
<p><strong>Carole A. Travis Henikoff</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">February 18, 2008</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Conceived during the middle hours of many nights, October 2007,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">aboard the barge, La Tortue, on the Canal du Midi, France.</span></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Alice</strong></span></p>
<p>As Alice Landsbury exited the jet-way, her mind went blank. The skin of her body began to prickle with fear. This was not La Guardia. Frantically her eyes swept the space in which she stood. There was a floor, a beautiful floor, but where were the walls? Then she saw a woman waving and smiling twenty feet in front of her.  In her hand was a sign that read &#8220;Alice Landsbury.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman with the sign walked toward her. Mystified, Alice accepted the woman&#8217;s extended hand. Her handshake was somehow settling. &#8220;Alice! So glad you made it &#8211; wonderful to see you! I know this is all a bit confusing but everything is in order. Somehow you got shuttled onto another flight. We will get you back to New York on a 6:30 flight. Not to worry, my dear, not to worry. I have been sent to take you under my wing. My name is Martha Telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martha&#8217;s countenance was soothing, but Alice&#8217;s brain was still whirling in an effort to understand where she was. What was with this building, or whatever the hell it was?</p>
<p>Taking two cup-size bottles of water from her bag, Martha handed one to Alice, then opened the other and began to drink. Lowering the bottle from her lips she said, &#8220;I know you are thirsty from your travels. Our water here is the very best. Cheers!&#8221; Instantly, a tremendous thirst hit Alice&#8217;s senses and she quickly opened her bottle and downed its contents. By the time she lowered the empty bottle from her lips, every emotion and chemical response connected with fear had vanished. Alice still didn&#8217;t know where she was, but as Martha had said, &#8220;Everything was in order.&#8221; Actually, everything was wonderful and exciting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Martha! May I call you Martha? Wonderful! I want to know everything. Where am I? What is this building? Is it a building?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, now, my dear. Let&#8217;s take things at a decent pace. I have much to tell you. Come, we&#8217;ll go to my place where we can have a bit to eat and relax while I fill you in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking Alice&#8217;s arm, Martha walked her purposefully towards a road that appeared to run from the edge of the floor and stretch into the horizon. Suddenly they were outside. Martha steadied Alice lest she fall. Roads and buildings unlike anything Alice had ever seen filled her visual cortex, which strived to correlate the incoming stimulus to something in its memory bank. The building across a broad green road looked somewhat like a morel mushroom, while the one next to it resembled a Venus flytrap with strangely shaped windows where natural patterning would exist. Odd kidney bean-shaped conveyances of various sizes whizzed back and forth along the green road. Staring at them Alice realized they possessed neither wheels nor drivers.</p>
<p>Martha guided Alice onto a ramp. What Alice took to be a train pulled up and they walked into it through what appeared to be an ancient arch complete with lion heads.</p>
<p>The two women settled into small but incredibly comfortable seats that molded themselves to their bodies. Alice felt as though she was having a soft-touch massage, though there was no actual sensation of being touched.</p>
<p>There were others on the train. Like Martha, they were extremely good looking, in perfect condition, and dressed in an array of outfits. As if reading Alice&#8217;s mind, Martha explained that &#8220;everyone here has a profession and every profession is identified by attire. It makes things wonderfully easy and increases contact and the exchange of knowledge between the professions. One must never stop learning, but no one can know everything. In talking with a person from another profession, one can increase their knowledge base, thus enhancing their life. Everyone here is a teacher within his or her field of expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is &#8216;here&#8217;? Where am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nextime. You have been selected for a visit. I am a relater.  I was born with an eidetic memory coupled with a love of learning and history in combination with a passion for imparting knowledge to others. I was chosen to be your guide. In school I studied human history starting with the first up-right ape of some seven million years ago. For this assignment I went into an extreme-virtual-reality-study-mode concerning the  timeframe you are from. Is my English and dialect understandable to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Isn&#8217;t English your first language?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, my dear. We all speak several languages but find telepathy to be the most accurate form of information transmission. I&#8217;m using a great deal of telepathy on you at the moment, though your brain doesn&#8217;t recognize it as your visual cortex is watching the movements of my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;During my learning period I visited your world from your yesterday back to three hundred years prior to your birth. I know and understand the world in which you currently exist. Oh, here we are.&#8221; Taking Alice&#8217;s arm, Martha guided Alice off the train through what looked like a tree-lined French country road. As the two women got up to disembark, Alice noticed that everyone on the train looked at her with wonderful eyes of kindness and acceptance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nextime? What is this? Am I dreaming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you may very well tuck this journey into the safety of a dream should your mind be incapable of accepting the experience, which is a real probability. Then again, you may not remember any of this. It&#8217;s a common response.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice stared out at a beautiful wooded settlement of low sprawling homes and occasional spires that she took to be condos. From the train they walked a ribbon of walkway across gently sloping ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this where you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in the that spire over there. Third floor, lovely view.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming upon a large plum tree dripping with deep purple fruit, Martha stopped and scanned the tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, marvelous! We have our dessert,&#8221; she said as she climbed a brown, bark-looking ladder to reach four perfectly ripened plums. Handing them to Alice she climbed down, took a small woven sack out of her bag and opened it for Alice, who gently placed the fruit within after sniffing their incredible perfume.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this your tree?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/ll363/dougmez/pubtest-08-20-08-SU7RLMM-004-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="296" />&#8220;No, it belongs to everyone. All of the trees you see produce some kind of fruit or nut. In certain weather areas hardwoods or wood pines are grown for human pleasure, but also for culling when the time is right. Everyone picks and gathers their own fruits and vegetables. Any excess is harvested and made into foodstuffs for the winter or sent to other climes. I have been watching that cluster of plums for some time now. It&#8217;s nice they reached their perfection in time for you to enjoy them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very beautiful here. Is this the outskirts of the city I landed in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, my dear. We&#8217;re a thousand miles from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we were only on the train for a few moments!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. But, you must understand that our technologies are far advanced from the technologies of your world. We have learned to use the power of various electromagnetic wavelengths, particularly that of visible light. Rembrandt was prescient when he said that light was everything. Your scientists are just beginning to understand the possible uses of our sun. Aside from getting our power base from manipulated photons, we heal all sorts of psychological and physical problems common to your era by focusing various wavelengths of light through the lens of the eye. Optical therapies work by genetically engineering brain cells so as to change or modify behavior. We have pretty much eradicated depression, addictions, epilepsy, convulsive disorders and extreme aggressive disorder. Of course there are many other therapies, from vibration centering to sound therapy, but such procedures are seldom needed today as the vast majority of people are mentally fit and well adjusted. It&#8217;s rare to come upon someone who has suffered from such ailments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Staring at Martha, Alice asked, &#8220;Are you a robot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha! Marvelous! Smart question. Tells me why you were chosen. You are a thinker. The answer is no. I&#8217;m a human, everyone you see here is a human, though we do use robots and ultra-smart computers in multiple ways. Robots clean all our roads, walkways and outside areas. Every abode is self-cleaning. You might enjoy the fact that our cleaning robots sense when people are not around and immediately set to their task. If a person should exit a building or enter their abode while a cleaner is at work, the robot will beg their pardon and excuse themselves. They are programmed with all of the world&#8217;s languages and have extremely sensitive odor sniffers, mainly for ferreting out molecules of disease and so forth, but also to recognize people&#8217;s sex, age and often their profession. Some of their wild remarks can really make your day.&#8221;</p>
<p>By now the two women were walking up a pathway of muted colors that changed with each step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are.&#8221; said Martha as they approached an amazing wooden door carved with a relief of a fabulous chestnut tree whose top branches appeared to have wormed their way into the wall. Holding up her wristband the door swung open. A non-existent butler said, &#8220;Good Afternoon, Madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Afternoon, Charles. Any calls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three Madam. I&#8217;ve posted them on your screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transfixed, Alice entered into a seventeenth century paneled room with coffered ceiling. Rembrandt&#8217;s self-portrait, the one done during his last years where he is heavily gowned and capped against the chill of an un-heated house, stared out at her from its gold-crusted frame. &#8220;Is that the real thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. We can replicate anything with total exactness. Everyone chooses whatever kind of art and trappings from whatever era, or eras, they like in order to decorate their abode to their liking. If I awoke tomorrow and wished for a total makeover, I&#8217;d tell Charles my desires and he&#8217;d order a re-do to my specifications. It takes two to three days. I usually go on holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Charles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles is my ATC. My all-sensory, total-knowledge, computer-servant&#8230; and a real friend, I might add. Charming fellow; a mega computer to your way of thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Approximately 60% of us never marry. There&#8217;s no reason to. Marrieds are usually those who have signed up to win the right to have a child or people who have found everything they want in one person. I have never encountered one person that filled all of my needs, but I have four marvelous mates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you care to fill me in on ‘mates&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In your timeframe you would call them lovers, but here in Nextime they are more than lovers. They are mind-mates, food and drink mates, sports mates, strictly sexual mates, or a combination. Our ATC&#8217;s keep all of us apprised of availability and confirm meetings at our request. Oh, and I also have a wonderful sleep-companion, Don. I just love him. He&#8217;s such a special friend. You see, we seldom stay the night with our mates unless on holiday together, yet many of us love to cuddle or curl up with someone when we go to bed. Don often comes over for the night. In the morning we go our separate ways. Our lives are very full. Between work, play, continued learning, the arts, sports and agriculture, we&#8217;re a busy lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If everyone has multiple lovers aren&#8217;t you afraid of STDs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember what it stands for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sexually Transmitted Diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, those were wiped out a long time ago along with most of the diseases that plague your timeframe. The scientists of your era are just beginning to climb the stairs of knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about people who want children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place couples can&#8217;t just do it on their own. Those who are found to be eligible sign up for the raffle after they prove their qualifications for parenting and have their chemical make-up thoroughly examined for health and heredity concerns. Most importantly, they must show that they are truly in love and truly wish to marry and bear a child. After all, parenting is a big job; in our society it demands a great deal of work and dedication.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you know if someone truly loves another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bodies are electro-chemical organisms with limited mass. It would be impossible to lie to testing computers. Only perfectly attuned people are allowed to be breeders. If chosen they are allowed two children so long as their genetic group&#8217;s population is low enough to accommodate a second child. The object is to keep the global population at the current optimum population of 2.65 billion people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8211; oh, I have so many questions &#8211; I mean, how do you keep people from having children? Where did all the people go? There are close to seven billion people living today &#8211; in my time, I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the problem, my dear, you are loving yourselves to death. Huge populations of people are having children for all the wrong reasons. From responses to age-old, to reptilian brain chemical stimulus, to religious and political beliefs that work against progress and a better life. You are running out of potable water, tearing down your forests, depleting your oceans, running out of food, killing one another, and the list goes on and on. And you know, I couldn&#8217;t find anything or anyone within the last decades of your existence that addressed the obvious! As I studied your timeframe I found it astonishing &#8211; and disheartening &#8211; to see that once again, humankind had chosen to blind itself to the obvious: over breeding breeds war, genocide, and can even wipe out a group or an entire species. It&#8217;s like a bloom in a Petri dish. Place a few bacteria on the bottom of a gel-glazed Petri dish, cover it and allow them to split, divide and multiply. All goes well until the bacteria cover the entirety of the dish, then there is a gigantic, frantic division of cells, which is called a bloom. Then, poof &#8211; every last bacterium dies en masse. The old Harvard rat experiments proved the same with mammals; and, as I&#8217;m sure you know, we are mammals with the same old reptilian brain that runs the hearts, lungs and emotions of all mammals. You, my beautiful friend, are living in the midst of a bloom.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/ll363/dougmez/alice3-5.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="352" />While visiting your timeframe, I watched girls who had no bio-chemicals marking them for motherhood doing anything and everything to get pregnant. I saw children living in conditions that we wouldn&#8217;t allow any life form to live in and parents with unwanted children blaming others for their plight, as if others had forced them to conceive. Worst of all, everyone in your generation seems to think that everything that happens to them is someone else&#8217;s fault. More amazingly, is that many willingly take the blame for things they didn&#8217;t do. Only a child that is wanted by parents capable of caring for and educating it is allowed to enter Nextime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, let me get this straight, everyone&#8217;s life is controlled and some Big Brother is running the show, right? Are you communists? Or do you live under a robotic dictator?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my dear, I have wounded your senses. I will have to do three hours of re-training for allowing my emotions to flail around like a half blown balloon. Communism only works within groups of a hundred or less, and only if like-minded, and dictatorships went by the boards ages ago. You must understand. Humanity, along with a majority of earth&#8217;s life forms, came close to total collapse&#8230; you know, extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened? Did we blow ourselves to Kingdom Come? Did some disease get us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to tell you the near future, Alice. Suffice it to say, that many great minds came to recognize that over-population was the root cause of 90% of the world&#8217;s problems, from polluting the atmosphere, which adds to natural warming, to insufficiencies of essentials,to genocide. At that time, when humanity was on the crux of self-annihilation, various world leaders, from countries large and small, held secret meetings where they had the courage to formulate and execute measures that would ensure the continuation of the human species. Some of the measures were drastic, but they kept us from total extinction. Funny how people of that time period, appeared to be incapable of accepting the fact that our species could go extinct. Many of our scientists continue to debate on the psychological mindset of the times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what did we do? Kill off sixty-five percent of the Earth&#8217;s population?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have another bottle of water or there isn&#8217;t a chance of you remembering any of this. You are getting too emotional and it&#8217;s my fault. I was the first to get emotional &#8211; terribly unprofessional of me. Please forgive me. Like most people who love history, we often wish we could go back and save the world, even though we understand what you refer to as the ‘butterfly effect.&#8217; You know, if you get in a time machine and go back millions and millions of years, then foolishly get out of the machine and step on a butterfly, you and the world you know wink out of existence because that butterfly was an evolutionary link to a mutation, etc. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of it. It&#8217;s not on the mark, but it&#8217;s a good metaphor. The past cannot be messed with, but you can work towards a better future, and that&#8217;s what eventually happened and is still happening. Everyone&#8217;s goal in Nextime is towards a better future, including tomorrow and next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did we get to your Nextime?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can only give you a view of the treetops, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m allowed. Besides, it would take months of lessons and the learning of new sciences for you to comprehend it all. What I can tell you is that people, great masses of people, were contained in learning centers where they were told the truth about their bodies, their minds, and how a child&#8217;s brain can be configured through his environment to believe whatever his teachers teach him. During the first week of learning everyone received a thorough mental and physical check-up and were non-invasively sterilized, but for a few who showed fine breeding potential. Those suffering from chemical dependences, aggressive disorders, and the like, were light-treated. Those who did not respond to treatment were incarcerated. Many eventually healed, though some had to be put to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People were sterilized and killed without consent or recourse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well my dear, the ‘people&#8217; had chosen to believe that they could and should have children whenever they wanted and as many as they wanted. They never thought about the effect their fecundity was having on planet Earth. They cared not a wit about her. The earth&#8217;s biomass was dying. Daring people came to the rescue. For many it was horrible, so steeped were they in their beliefs. Some took their lives, being incapable of understanding the paths that, in time, would save their species and life on Earth &#8230;to say nothing of their descendents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nextime sounds dictatorial and atheistic to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no. A vast majority of us are religious though the word &#8216;spiritual&#8217; would best describe us. Of course there are atheists, but they constitute a small minority. Most of the religions of your timeframe had a solid foot in the reality of what is, but sly and manipulative men and women took the essence of reality and molded demanding and commanding belief systems around the truth that is felt by all living things. In other words, they took a great and basic force and used it to their benefit. Innately sensing the truth-effect, populations followed religious leaders, even into battle where they stood by or helped to annihilate ‘non-believers&#8217; in tortuous ways for not believing as they believed. There is only one truth &#8211; not multiples &#8211; and it existed long before planet earth came into existence. It resides in all things throughout the universe and cannot be separated or explained&#8230; even now. Our most amazing brains have tried to get a handle on what we feel but cannot see, sense, or explain. Most of us accept the wonder of the unknown and understand that we are the stewards of our planet and its inhabitants as are life forms on other planets scattered throughout the Universe. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the same in the multiple universes that exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have proven the existence of other universes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, quite some time ago. But getting back to The Transition and the point I was making, during those first times of reversal we tallied the people in each and every genetic group. Sterilization was performed in accordance with population tallies so that after a period of 76 years there were like numbers of people left within each of the major genetically distinct groups. Some peoples, living in small groups in deep forests, were left alone. Only those who chose to enter the populous world were subjected to the rules of child-bearing and sterilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds brutally cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary! I have adopted four children whose electro-chemical signatures match with mine. I often take them on holiday or attend school with them so that after class we can communicate child to adult about their lessons. The children are all of a mental neighborhood, and the birthing parents are close friends of mine. They often have a get together and call for a time of feasting. Then all of the children&#8217;s adoptive parents, uncles and aunts &#8211; a child might have a dozen or more adoptives &#8211; bring books and games or pieces of art, along with favored foods. It&#8217;s very much like Christmas in your era; a big family gathering brought together through the love and caring of children. In Nextime, every child is encouraged to grow to their fullest potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever want to have children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. My genetic group&#8217;s quota was full, and there were so many babies whose lives I could tap into. Besides, I was having so much fun working towards my life-degrees that I never gave it great deal of thought. When the parenting chemicals of the old reptilian brain are held in check and you learn how much it costs the planet to raise and maintain every individual that&#8217;s born, you simply want to do the right thing. Actually, when a person isn&#8217;t expected to produce offspring by their society, religion, or community, the brain is free to expand and add to the progression of knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slightly embarrassed, Alice asked, &#8220;Do they cut out your sex-drive through one of their ‘therapies&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Humans are hugely sensual. We are totally sexually liberated. I have never had to worry about getting pregnant and am allowed full expression of my natural needs so long as I express myself in private so as not to offend others. And, unlike your timeframe, rape simply doesn&#8217;t happen in Nextime. If it was ever attempted, the victim&#8217;s wristband would sense the fear and panic and send out an alarm. The rapist&#8217;s wristband would take note of his brain chemicals and administer a sedative. Whenever stressful situations occur, our wristbands work to protect us and record the incident. Besides, there is no way a rapist could deny or get away with such a brutal act. In Nextime everyone knows that attraction and sex are normal, healthy, and wonderful parts of life. I might add, without all the hype that is so rampant within your timeframe, it isn&#8217;t a, what do you say? &#8230; a <em>big deal? </em>it&#8217;s simply a fulfilling, enjoyable part of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmmm. I noticed that everyone on the train was beautiful, healthy and happy. Don&#8217;t you have bad or sad people? Or people less fortunate, you know, on the down and outs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, no! Within an hour of my birth my chemical signature was registered. By the age of six I was found to be stable and my signature indeed marked me for being a relater. In Nextime every infant is screened and put onto an educational track that will allow them the most fulfillment in life. During The Transition, sociopathic personalities were eliminated. Even today, large business heads, politicians, philosophers, scientists, and the like are thoroughly screened against adverse personality traits. If a child is born with genes that code for lying and aggressive leadership, he or she is put through robotized therapy starting at the age of four. We came to understand the fallibility of human minds&#8230; so many of us have a natural desire to control the minds of others. But, computers can be programmed against partiality or false persuasion of any kind. Computer-psychiatrists converse with a person through a three-dimensional life-size optical screen, its questions and replies projected through the likes of a man or woman geared to the patient&#8217;s personality. This is done as even in Nextime we possess a need to feel connected with others of our own kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you put little kids on a shrink&#8217;s couch?&#8230; ah, so to speak?&#8221;<img class="alignright" src="http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/ll363/dougmez/pubtest-08-20-08-SU7RLMM-004-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="157" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In Nextime, we never think of anyone or ourselves as patients; that is a very old term. We all recognize that it is normal to have attributes that may work against us, thus limiting our potential. There is a real desire within us all to be as healthy in body and mind as possible. Therapy is a blessing that allows for a rebalancing of ones emotions. Basically, we work against the human capacity for hurting others of their own species by helping everyone to be in tune with positive action. For instance, naturally born power seekers and builders of industry are encouraged to climb traditional business ladders, but their benefits are restricted; there are no billionaires. Those who attain high status through contributions to business, science, and the like are rewarded through recognition for their talents. Many achieve fame and award, but excessive greed is not allowed. In your timeframe you would say that such traits were against the law. Nevertheless, great minds are revered for their contributions. They live and travel well, but computers account for all profits and the distribution of funds. We don&#8217;t have terms for what you call &#8216;graft&#8217; and &#8216;fraud.&#8217; Big business and political positions are held for terms of four years. Top brains rotate positions within their individual fields of brilliance. This allows them to work with a great many people from various parts of the globe to whom they can pass on their knowledge, their unique ideas, and ways of solving problems. Since your timeframe, knowledge within the sciences has increased exponentially to the benefit and delight of the world at large.</p>
<p>During The Transition, chemical and light therapy, along with mental training, were used to retrain warlords, corrupt individuals, and anyone who was using power to harm others. Today, warmongers and wily business personalities are a rarity but are easily singled out and dealt with. During the roughest times of The Transition, some of these personalities proved to be beyond help, being incapable of change. Many went mad &#8211; what do you say? &#8216;Flipped off the deep end?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flipped out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do love your idioms. At any rate, many <em>flipped out</em> when they realized they could no longer control the lives of others in harmful ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some fell into depressions so deep we couldn&#8217;t help them. Many committed suicide, while others agreed to mind therapy and changed their lives around &#8230;I guess that would be &#8216;minds&#8217; rather than &#8216;lives.&#8217; After all, we are what we eat and think, and what you think is usually what you have been taught. That&#8217;s why every child in Nextime is taught various ways of thinking, how to question intelligently, and look at all things from many sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our world works towards the benefit of all living things, though to varying degrees. What I mean is that humans are similar to one another and yet each individual is unique unto him or herself. All peoples are regarded with respect as to the lifestyle they are most comfortable with, so long as they produce within their field of work and do no harm to others. There are many who love to live quiet lives in the mountains, in deserts, or on lonely islands, while others gravitate towards business and the immense job of running the planet. Gifted people enter the sciences or fabulous artist, music, or writers&#8217; colonies. And, of course, there are those who carry the risk gene, who climb our highest peaks, explore neighboring planets, test dangerous space craft, and go to the bottom of ocean trenches to gather minerals and specimens for the making of medicines. No one earns the same number of credits &#8211; money in your world &#8211; as we all produce at different levels, but we all lead comfortable, and more importantly, fulfilling lives. What is demanded of each person are passing grades in higher education, continued learning (which I find the most fascinating), and respect for others. Every individual must prove him or herself self-sufficient through education and execution. By the time human over-population was decreased through natural attrition, children from every corner of the world were learning various languages by the ages of three to five and doing higher math by the age of twelve. In our early school years, we learn to memorize poems or parts of plays starting at the age of three. It was found that memorization teaches the young maturing brain how to lay down memory tracks, which benefit future learning processes, which leads to minds that can look at a situation and figure out a solution.</p>
<p>Following The Transition average intelligence soared. There hasn&#8217;t been a war for hundreds of years, and the last person to starve to death lived at least 200 years ago. We all know our history, and through knowing our past we are able to embrace life and enhance the future for up-coming generations. We are blessed to be living in our timeframe&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Martha had ushered Alice into a sunlit room that had areas Alice equated with a living, dining room, and kitchen space, though none of the usual kitchen apparatus was apparent other than a counter and handsome cabinets. To her left was a six-foot wide, floor to ceiling window in front of which stood a rack. Each shelf held a beautiful six-foot planter with all sorts of herbs, lettuces, radishes and tiny peppers growing in profusion. On the far end the planters were attached to a floor to ceiling, six-inch wide housing that was delightfully painted with various foodstuffs. Martha explained how the planters were automatically watered in response to moisture sensors housed within the end panel. Martha chatted on as she picked, plucked, and cut various items for a salad that soon accompanied a delicious filet of aquamarine-colored fish served with a side of aioli.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make sure we get a full compliment of Omega3 oil. The gathering and processing of fresh foods is essential to our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she fussed over lunch Martha explained that every building, be it a factory, house, barn, or condominium, was built over a cistern equal in size to its footprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the word, but I&#8217;m not sure what it is. It&#8217;s not a septic tank is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, no!&#8221; said Martha. &#8220;Septic tanks are for sewage. They are still employed in certain situations. A cistern is a rainwater collection receptacle, somewhat like an underground, capped swimming pool. The water is used in multiple ways; our in-home herb gardens, as well as the flushing of toilets and the watering of plant life that surround the building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still use toilets?&#8221; Alice asked with a grin.</p>
<p>Laughing back, Martha replied, &#8220;Yes, but they use very little water. We still use something you would recognize. Our bodies haven&#8217;t changed in any basic way. All sewage is treated and processed into fertilizers; nothing is wasted in Nextime. I think your era coined the adage ‘waste not, want not&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice sighed, &#8220;Guess we have forgotten how to do that. You should see the trash we create.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. I watched a film of what happened when the sanitation workers went on strike in New York, Naples and other places. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. Amazing. What an incredible waste of resources!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about bathing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All condos and communities have bathing spas, much as the Japanese of your timeframe who bathe prior to entering their communal baths. We &#8216;bathe&#8217; by walking through various scanners and ionic wave machines that destroy all harmful and odor producing microbes and molecules from our bodies prior to entering the baths. Each domicile has the same kind of machines &#8211; smaller of course. They are wonderful. They keep us clean and healthy and you can clean and refresh your clothes and linens without water, soap, or ironing in nothing flat. Our health monitors are quite thorough, down to the detection of a hangnail. Our homes use lasers to eradicate dust, mildew and dirt; it&#8217;s all automatic and done in our absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martha smiled as she set beautiful plates of food on the table and asked Alice to be seated. Alice was hungry. Very hungry. Funny, she couldn&#8217;t remember ever feeling hunger or ingesting food in a dream &#8211; at least not like this. Looking up, somewhat perplexed, Alice realized that Martha Telling was still telling. She was boasting that everyone worked at least three hours a week in a community garden or near-by forest, and that children were taught beginning gardening starting at the age of four, with a stair-step program that continued throughout their school years. It taught everything from grafting techniques to tree pruning. Those born with genetics geared for agriculture ran the large community gardens and large-scale agribusinesses. Hunger was unheard of and no one was overweight. The psychological underpinnings of obesity, and so-called edibles, that worked against the body rather than for it were well understood and counteracted, often through consensual banning. All foods grown, harvested, or produced worked towards perfect health. The phrase &#8220;junk food&#8221; had become slang for anything that might harm you, be it a comestible or a proposed gadget that didn&#8217;t make it through inspection. Changing subjects, Martha said that whenever a person&#8217;s wristband indicated they had a problem, be it medical or psychological, they immediately went to their local clinic for evaluation and repair &#8211; a word Martha said had no adverse meaning. Being &#8220;repaired&#8221; was equivalent to the intelligent act of putting a band aid on a cut. Excluding those who died in accidents, natural disasters, or war-games, the average age at death was 110. Martha said her grandmother lived to be a 126. Suicidal people were treated for depression. Should repeat treatments fail to work and a person persisted in wanting to move on, they were surrounded by loved ones and allowed to go their way. They were given full honor and funeral rights. There were no drug addicts or alcoholics. People partied, loved theatre, music, dance, fine food, wine, and all things enjoyable. Should a person consume a mind-changing chemical substance, their wristband monitored their intake. If one surpassed their intake capacity, their wristband set off a low frequency alarm. If the person persisted to imbibe, a second, louder alarm would sound and their wristband would administer a sedative.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/ll363/dougmez/pubtest-08-20-08-SU7RLMM-004-1-3.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="239" />&#8220;We live lives that seldom cause embarrassment, but hearing your wrist band alarm go off in a social setting would be embarrassing. Besides, should you be born with the genes that code of any kind of substance abuse or addictive behavior, the dangerous genes are deactivated. So it really isn&#8217;t a problem. But you know, even a perfectly normal person can get into a situation where they accept that extra glass of wine. We all love our wristbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. But your wristbands sound like Big Brother to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Alice. It&#8217;s very different. There are no humans monitoring us. Our wristbands are like having a wise teacher, the best of doctors, and a loving parent with you at all times, to say nothing of wearing a computer on your wrist twenty times more powerful than the biggest and most up-to-date computer of your time. Our wristbands are incredible, life-saving tools that help us lead wonderful lives. If I&#8217;m falling in love with someone I just met and act stupid enough to cause my alarm to go off three times within a period of a year, I would have to submit to rehab. Obviously, I&#8217;m not going to do that to myself. Besides, by the age of fifteen I had a complete understanding of the chemicals released by the brain when love is blossoming and knew the best ways in which to enjoy the experience and get the most out of it. Why would anyone take away his own innate ability to ‘fall in love&#8217;? There&#8217;s no reasonable excuse to prompt an alarm other than emotional trauma, so if a person repeatedly causes his alarm to go off, he obviously has an underlying problem he needs to have rehabbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds great, but I still feel like I&#8217;m sitting in The Brave New World&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, no! However, the book is on the Classics list that everyone must read. It is an excellent example of how primitive we were in your era, while at the same time, being prescient to future possibilities. When the book was written, science had yet to understand the genetics and electrochemical realities of animals and plants, particularly humans. Good book. I remember loving the read.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I still want to know how we moved into Nextime. What happened? Was it all out war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Classified. But large die-offs had begun in reaction to various occurrences, most of which were perpetrated or caused by humanity. At the same time, several positive things occurred. Science learned more about the chemical makeup of the human brain, physicists discovered how to harness the immense power emanating from our sun and surrounding universe, and great thinkers began to disseminate the truth, bringing vast populations up out of the darkness of misguided religious and political thought. The Transition, as horrendous as some aspects of it were, acted as a re-birth for the earth and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to listen. I&#8217;ll tell you what I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through light beam technology an entire population could be calmed and educated to the wonders of reality. Reality had been stifled, history had been re-written &#8211; a devilish, arrogant deed if ever there was one &#8211; and people had clung to ancient, fearful belief systems as over-population crowded them into huddled, confused balls of fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; So, again, you sterilized people without their permission?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, it was that or the demise of the human race. You know, when you cut a five-inch high dandelion in the spring with your lawnmower, the plant will produce another batch of flowers with four-inch stalks. Cut it down again, it will lay its stems down into the grass. By the end of the summer it will produce at least one bloom with almost no stalk so that its flower can flourish below the level of your lawnmower&#8217;s blade. Bottom line? Life will persist at all cost. Prior to the 1900&#8217;s, fifty percent of all human first births resulted in the death of the child, mother, or both. If a woman had several children, few made it to adulthood. As for disease and accidents, until the advent of what you call &#8216;modern&#8217; medicine, few people could be cured. In your Civil War, countless soldiers died of festering wounds that could have easily been handled in your day and age. But, as you improved your health and increased longevity, you failed to recognize that the very discoveries that were saving you and your babies would create a bloom. As more and more people crowded your cities and streets, the chemicals emanating from your old reptilian brain produced an underlying sense of fear brought on by the crowding of your senses. For millions of years, humans lived in small to moderately sized groups. Even here in Nextime, our central nervous systems haven&#8217;t learned to gear themselves for crowded situations. Of course, the outer, newer layers of our brains, being the most powerful on earth, learned to cope as survival mechanisms came into play and the strategist within figured out how to live under the constant threat produced by over-crowding. Your New York City is just one prime example of the incredible ability humans possess for adaptation. But, as crucial necessities of life became scarce and large-scale, over-population filled one country after another, several things happened: war, genocide, greed, and starvation, even cannibalism, circled the globe. And still, you didn&#8217;t notice. There wasn&#8217;t a problem on earth, from disease and war, to famine and the inability to the cut produce enough food for all peoples, that couldn&#8217;t have been diminished or eradicated completely with fewer people on the planet. Not only didn&#8217;t you notice, but billions believed that every child came from their chosen &#8216;god&#8217;, as opposed to an act of fornication. In many societies, men believed that only by making a woman pregnant could they prove to be a man, never realizing that any cow, lizard, or rodent could do the same. You, forgive me for saying so, are living in mental caves set in what you call &#8216;modern&#8217; societies.</p>
<p>Prior to the fall, a global, subconscious fear arose within the human family. Knowing that potable water was becoming scarce, that all-out war was a real threat, and that you were killing the biota of the planet on which you lived, the old reptilian brain did what dandelions still do; it chemically signaled for more births. It was a Death Knell. Sterilization was the only chance humans had for survival. But we didn&#8217;t simply sterilize people, we opened their minds to the truth. The truth about their bodies and how brain chemicals could send a person down the wrong path, the psychological and emotional consequences of over-crowding, and also the fact that it was more humane to sterilize people and allow them to live out their lives than eradicate masses of people in order to cut numbers more quickly. A not-too-surprising outcome was that men started working together, rather than against one another. Women became better, more loving parents whether they were a birthing parent or an adoptive. People started to relax as multiple stresses were lifted from their lives. And of course, sterilization allowed millions of women to achieve numerous goals that raising a family would have precluded. Meanwhile, children were loved and cared for, each receiving the education best suited to their natural talents. The sick and elderly were treated with respect and caring, usually surrounded by comforting pets, children, and teenagers who did things for them in return for stories of the past.</p>
<p>Still, it must be admitted that the beginning years of The Transition were difficult. Over-population was such that the first two birthing cycles had to be spaced ten years apart. That decision produced a heartrending side. Women who had subconsciously responded dramatically to multiple fears and experienced overt chemical signals to bear children couldn&#8217;t handle not being picked for bearing. Many took their lives before programs were set in place to deal with their psychological and chemical problems. It was terribly sad. To me, they were the most poignant victims of over-population. Some were so distraught over losing the draw they tried to kill the chosen. Quick action had to be taken. Bearing couples were sequestered and protected while those who had become enraged and dangerous were taken in for treatment. Unfortunately, some had to be let go for the safety of humanity. Most understood the drastic state of things, and after listening to the facts, what was being implemented, and the reasons for measures taken, they took positive stands. There were many problems, especially in societies where men had ruled over women to the point of having the right to kill them should they displease them. The effect of having total domination rights stripped from them was simply too much for many of them. Once again, many withered away, while others took their own lives. Change is always difficult. Climbing out of our caves, taking the next step, has always been hard for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the people rise up and try to fight against what was happening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were loud voices and many threats, but things were so horrific that anything that promised a future was seen as positive. Of course, without light treatment I don&#8217;t know if The Transition could have been implemented. Fortunately, the new technologies allowed millions, and then billions, to accept the realization that the only way to have every individual count and provided with a safe and full life was through the lowering of our numbers and the imparting of knowledge. As more and more of the general populous came to understand the situation, they joined ranks and helped with the process. There were many who dedicated their lives to helping those who had a hard time coping with the changes necessary for our survival as a species. With tight controls on population and each child being loved and well schooled a truly golden age began to emerge. When a child is loved and taught to think, when it is schooled in many subjects that mesh to present the whole, the child will grow to make intelligent, salient decisions. We Nextimers understand and appreciate the multiple freedoms and mandatory limitations that work in combination to produce an abundance of pay-offs that allow for global harmony. Would you like a nice cup of tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be very nice. Thank you. So, I think I understand the sterilization bit, though it boggles my mind. Anyway, I want to know something else. In Nextime everyone is happy, healthy, extremely smart, nobody makes war, and everyone loves everyone else? Right?&#8221;<img class="alignright" src="http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/ll363/dougmez/alice3-4.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="282" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. This isn&#8217;t Pollyanna Ville. Some ethnic groups showed a dislike for people they considered to be &#8216;different,&#8217; so antagonistic groups were kept apart. Once childbearing and genetic group size were precisely regulated, no one could build up a population large enough to overwhelm another. Actually, within a hundred years of The Transition, the separation of genetic groups became rather fuzzy, then disappeared all together. As new generations were taught the mistakes of the past, along side the wonders of new sciences, they realized how fulfilling life could be, so long as we continued to work against the natural aggression that continues to surface within us from brain chemicals that have governed our behavior since the beginning and continue to do so, even in this day and age. I mean, even in Nextime we can&#8217;t help but follow the Four F template: Flee, Fight, Feed and Fornicate. All living creatures maintain their species via the Four F&#8217;s, even plants &#8211; in ways of their own &#8211; follow these mandatory laws of nature. In your timeframe, and more so in mine, humans are capable of annihilating the lot of us. Such capabilities demand the restraint of the second F.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all we have combative sports that test the strongest among us. No drugs of any kind are allowed and anyone who wants to be part of the games is tested. The testing is done by machine, so if a person fails to pass no one will know, as only the winning scores are recorded. We also allow young aggressives to fight in contained wars, using ancient weapons in land arenas that are surrounded by high walls upon which spectators can watch. Opposing sides can never be composed of a single genetic group, and regulations and admittance to war games are vigorous; few warrior applicants make the grade. Those who pass have their wristbands put on stand-still prior to competing in a war, then re-started afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice sat staring at Martha. &#8220;Do they kill each other in these ‘games&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. It&#8217;s real war &#8211; small in scale, but very real. Sometimes the casualties are great, but the games seem to fill a human need we have yet to grow out of. The games confine the bloodshed and, how do you say it, <em>blow the steam off?,</em> the general population.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazing. You have banned war, worked towards peace and then let young men go out and kill each other in game-wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, the human species is the most complicated <em>mental-bender</em>on the planet&#8230;I love that term, don&#8217;t you? Over the course of millions of years we became ever more intelligent and cunning, to the point where we actually thought of ourselves as being outside of the Animal Kingdom. Of course, physiology proves us to be animals. It&#8217;s just that we are way smarter than all others and possess self-awareness &#8211; the thing you call a conscience. Did you know that sociopaths lack a conscience? But never mind the sociopaths, we took care of them; still, the majority of humans born in Nextime carry many of our old weaknesses.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are so good at gene manipulation, why don&#8217;t you just excise all of the bad genes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, it was found that if you over modulate the genes of any species it will lose its evolved potential and abilities to the point of extinction. In every species, including our own, it&#8217;s the same. We can do many things to enhance and correct the health, mind, and personality of an individual, but there are limitations and our scientists have learned them well. We have had to accept our strengths and our weaknesses. War is an expression of an old, beneficial survival mechanism that became a weakness when weapons of mass destruction were invented. Our war games cause as little harm as possible with willing subjects. You should understand that through the millions of years of our gradual evolution life was extremely difficult with everything from huge hyenas and lions to enemy neighbors threatening our lives on a daily basis. Life was extremely hard; more difficult then you or I can possibly imagine. That&#8217;s why we are so smart. If we hadn&#8217;t learned how to kill those that threatened us we would have gone extinct. We have yet to evolve out of the flee and fight defense mechanisms honed over the millennia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you just play brutal sports that are rough but don&#8217;t kill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we do, and the attending crowds are huge, but it was found that, as with the bull fight of the Spaniards, Death must be given its due. There are great treatises on the subject and a great portion of the population shuns not only the war games but all sports that pit men against one another. Those who are drawn to the games are not looked down upon, nor are those who shun them. You see, we are individuals and we respect the likes and dislikes of others. Most of all we are taught to be individuals who show consideration for others. We live by what you call the ‘Golden Rule&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice went silent; her eyes focusing on the bottom of her cup as her neurons kept cadence with the whirl of her spoon. Martha quieted as she picked up on Alice&#8217;s mentalizations. Then, in tones used for quieting a troubled child, she said, &#8220;Alice. We cannot remove our wristbands, they are a part of us.&#8221; Raising open palms towards Alice&#8217;s contorted face she continued, &#8220;You are wrong. For the last time, our wristbands do not constitute a Big Brother. Every act, be it mental or physical, elicits brain chemicals that code differently for all known responses within the human form. Our wristbands only interact with us to give warning when we are in danger, sick or in the midst of a crisis. They are set so as to erase every moment but for the last 50 hours when we are young, 100 hours as we age in order to monitor possible warning signs of stroke, heart attack or a failing organ &#8211; they allow us to live safe and amazing lives. The first components are installed at two weeks of age. As we grow more modules are added. By the time of completed brain maturity at the age of 24, our wristbands are complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still staring into her cup, Alice said &#8220;But, you said that if you screwed up three times you had to go into treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a good memory Alice. Anything that causes an alarm is permanently recorded in our wristbands in a file you would label ‘medical history&#8217;. Whenever we need to go to a healing center, for whatever reason, our medical history is downloaded so that we can be treated appropriately.&#8221; Alice looked up to find Martha&#8217;s eyes brimming with tears. She reached out and placed her right hand over Martha&#8217;s left. Martha asked, &#8220;Can you understand?&#8221; Alice nodded, as tears of her own filled her eyes. Every emotion seemed to wash through her, from rage and disbelief, to envy and awe seemed to swirl round and round in Alice&#8217;s mind leaving her in a haze of bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me to tell you a story. We have world-class mountain climbers who challenge the most impossible peaks, often alone. They are favored sports heroes. A few years back Jeffrey Hightower was climbing K2. He was 14 feet from the top when he fell more than a 1000 feet to his death. He was a magnificent climber; it didn&#8217;t seem right. But thanks to Jeffrey&#8217;s wristband, which naturally signed off with condolences when all body and brain functions had ceased, we know that it was an accident, that all fear chemicals were released as the fall began, and that they were replaced within seconds with a calm euphoria overlaid with chemicals we equate with enlightenment. You know, the wonder of an anomalous occurrence, or something akin to the eureka effect. Don&#8217;t you see? We not only know that it was an accident, but that he died in peace. There was no fear prior to his ultimate death. All of his mountain climbing friends understood completely and said that they live with the knowledge that such a fate is always a possibility. The majority of the world attended his funeral via their screens, many gathering in homes for the occasion. Without his wristband we could have never known the details of his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Observing Alice&#8217;s emotional response, Martha continued. &#8220;We view death as a transition. Matter can be turned into energy and energy can produce matter; neither can be annihilated. All things change. All things, at all times are in a state of transition. Nothing comes from nothing, and nothing can be completely nullified.</p>
<p>Sorry, this must be quite confusing to you. How about another cup of tea? I have some wonderful cookies. One of my neighbors loves to bake and we swap. I pick fruits and vegetables for her &#8211; she&#8217;s a tree-pruner &#8211; and she gives me cans of her wonderful cookies made with honey, eggs, raw oats, ground nuts and dried fruit meats. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice looked out at the clear blue sky as a flock of birds flew passed what Martha had called a &#8220;lookout&#8221;. She had explained to Alice that what she took to be a window was a one-way lookout; one could look out, but no one could look in. Alice pinched her leg. This couldn&#8217;t be real.</p>
<p>Still reading Alice&#8217;s mind, Martha took to an easier topic. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t asked, but I suppose it&#8217;s obvio us that we had to fix the numbers of animals other than ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do, gather in the squirrels and sterilize them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your humor. Actually, we did. Sounds funny, but humans had annihilated most predators &#8211; but for himself &#8211; and gone to adoring &#8216;cute&#8217; species that over-populated and often destroyed habitats. It took longer to work out the animals than it did the humans, but in time we cloned some of the extinct predators back into existence while cutting the populations of many prey species. Our biologists are still hard at work trying to get the earth&#8217;s biota back in balance. All and all, it&#8217;s much better than it was and the now-clean oceans and waterways are doing beautifully. Amazingly, as the planet became less stressed and a semblance of balance was achieved, some species, or species similar to extinct species, reappeared to the great and happy surprise of all.</p>
<p>Oh, oh. I&#8217;m afraid we must catch what you think is a train.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they exited Martha&#8217;s abode Charles said, &#8220;Have a nice day, Madam. Nice meeting you, Alice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, oh &#8230;thank you, Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the two women walked down the rainbow walk, Alice asked, &#8220;Do you think I will remember any of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know Alice, but I have a strong hunch you will dream.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Process started for me in Malibu in the early 90&#8217;s. I had been working with Skinny Puppy for several years and received an invitation to join the band as a full time visual artist. At the time I had pseudo net access (email and news reader) through a great unix BBS called the Edge Of Perception. It was enough to give me some access to the outside world and get me really thinking about this whole Internet thing, the impact it was having and going to have on us all. Keep in mind this was before Mosaic, the first visual web browser. The concept we had was to create an album length video in tandem with the recording of the new record for American Recordings. But we wanted to take it much further than this. I&#8217;ve long been a student of Marshall Mcluhan. The famous Canadian media theorist who coined the aphorism &#8220;The Media Is The Message&#8221;. I had also been reading Neil Postman who I thought did a good job of rounding up a lot of ideas regarding media technologies and their impact on culture. So basically I was thinking about developing the project as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a>. <span id="more-10"></span>The mythology of Skinny Puppy was already there. The consensual infrastructure was in place. It seemed like a pretty fertile garden for a homegrown media experiment.<br />
It was around that time that Genesis P Orridge strolled through the front door. Gen and I had a series of long talks about the project and I remember one fateful afternoon when I said &#8220;you know I have this idea that I can only refer to as cultural engineering&#8221;. He laughed and threw me his business card which said &#8220;G.P.O. Cultural Engineer&#8221;. Gen introduced me to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters">Merry Pranksters</a> and a bunch of really interesting stuff that was happening while I was still knee high to a grasshopper. He also introduced me to &#8220;The Process, Church of the Final Judgement&#8221; Immediately we were all drawn to the way the Process used pop culture as a means of propagating their message. There were also some striking parallels. The idea of shocking people into a state of awareness, animal rights activism, the dark image.<br />
We all felt we had found our muse. <a href="http://www.genesisp-orridge.com/">Genesis</a>, Adam Rostoker <a href="http://ajdrew.blogs.pagannation.com/2007/09/25/adam-walks-between-worlds-an-assasination/">(Adam Walks Between Worlds)</a> and I penned the original &#8220;Thee Process IS..&#8221; document and sent it out into the world causing mass confusion within our sphere. American Recordings got on board and released to the press, little quicktime movies that we created (on floppy disks) and spread the rumor that we were involved with a mysterious cult. When somehow, our landlord got wind of this, we almost got ejected from Shangri-La, (oh the irony that lies in that name) our studio and home. Robert Engen, a student at USC and a sys admin set us up with an ftp presence and a mailing list (which is still to this day a ghost in the machine of USC). The list immediately generated loads of traffic and took on a life of its own. The Process was to be an early open source project. We planned to have people send us sounds and images through the net which would be incorporated into the recording and video production. It worked. Although we were on 28.8 dial up connections, the phone line was humming away 24/7. It was a very exciting time.<br />
Unfortunately at the same time that our new Process meme was spreading through the internet, the band was imploding. The project would crash and burn just after it got off the ground. After salvaging what we could in terms of production in a studio in downtown L.A. (with the great help of the H-GUN crew) I returned to Vancouver. Ironically my 65 Renault 8 blew up about thirty miles from the Canadian border and I had to have it towed across.<br />
The project was dead but the process list had taken on quite a life of its own. At its peak in the mid nineties there were up to one hundred posts per day. People seemed to be finding identity and like minds through the Process meme. Loki got on board and pioneered the first process.org web presence. The contents of the ftp archive became the web site. Loki donated his NeXT computer so that we could have our own server independent of USC. We parked it on a T1 connection that was donated by Jean Yves Theriult. We gave server access to those who wanted to build upon the web site. The list folk created a variety of home grown projects. A threaded news reader of the list content, a music project that was a collaboration across the wires (including the production of the CD and artwork) and a project called &#8220;The Never Ending Story&#8221;. An open source story that anyone could add to.</p>
<p>Then one day, out of the blue, I received an email from someone claiming to be a real Processean from an existing chapter in the state of New York. That email was the only the start of a watershed of communication. I began to hear from several splinter groups of the original Process Church who, as it turns out, were both still active and keeping an eye on us. This was more than a surprise as I had, to this point, naively believed that the original Process Church was entirely defunct.<br />
It was during this time that we lost Dwayne Goettle. One of the most beautiful creative souls I&#8217;ve been privileged to know. Also during this time Adam Rostoker was gunned down in his home. His murder is still a mystery to this day.</p>
<p><em> Anecdotes from this era:</em></p>
<p><em>I received a cease and desist email from the Portland airport regarding our use of the Process logo. I replied and let them know that the four P symbol was not only an ancient swastika probably of Buddhist origins, but that its trademark was owned by a psychotherapy cult know as &#8220;The Process, The Church Of The Final Judgment&#8221;. I believe I cited William Sims Bainbridge&#8217;s book &#8220;Satan&#8217;s Power&#8221; with the page number reference that contained a picture of the logo. I never heard back from their legal dept&#8230;..;-)<br />
I once received an email from a gentlemen who claimed to be the first child born into the Process, as well as a Skinny Puppy fan. He warned me that associating with the Process moniker was tantamount to welcoming the FBI into your living room.<br />
I received an email from a man in prison who claimed to be a cell mate of David Berkowitz. He told me that he had read a lot of Process literature and just wanted me to know that Mr. Berkowitz&#8217;s claims regarding the Process were indeed bunk.</em></p>
<p>Eventually after the list had waned and traffic had dropped away we gave process.org over to a chapter of Processean&#8217;s based in NY. The site was active for a year or so and then appeared to go dormant. Eventually having no contact from the chapter I took it over once more to use it for a Vancouver based art collective called &#8220;Process Media Lab&#8221;. Not to be confused with Adam Parfreys publishing label <a href="http://www.processmediainc.com/">&#8220;Process Media&#8221;</a>.<br />
It was around this time that I was contacted by the Toronto chapter of The Process. I arranged to meet with the head of the chapter while visiting the city. We met on a corner of College street. He looked at me and said &#8220;you don&#8217;t look like a member of Skinny Puppy&#8221; Well, he didn&#8217;t show up wearing a black cape with the goat of mendes emblazoned on the front either! It was an excellent meeting and I think informative for both of us. I learned about the Process street missions. The members of the Toronto chapter had anonymously been running a resource management operation for the different charity organizations in the area but now felt it was time to resume direct action helping people on the streets.<br />
Since that time the web site has been in limbo with a little sentence proclaiming <em>&#8220;rebuilding&#8230;be back soon&#8221;</em>. I like to think that the flow of time is simply how you perceive it. So for me it&#8217;s just been a blink of the eye ;-). This thing that started as a social art experiment turned into a journey that has now spanned over a decade. Since we evoked it, it has always shadowed us. It&#8217;s taught me a few things over the years. Perhaps the biggest lesson is that you have to take responsibility for the things that you create. Once they are born they will always have some sort of attachment to you no matter where they go and how they develop outside of you. Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity may very well relate to ideas as well as objects.  An idea that is put in motion tends to remain in motion, and if ideas are faster than light, they must collect mass on route. I also learned that the concept of &#8220;open source&#8221; doesn&#8217;t just apply to software. It applies to ideas and actions. Here&#8217;s an example of what one man is doing to help a lot of people with an open source concept&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/54">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/54</a></p>
<p>So now we re-launch the web site. The aim of this blog is to create a virtual speak easy with a library of resources for learning. You&#8217;ll find most of our links on the side bar are geared towards getting the old neurons humming. If you look at the main link <a href="http://www.process.org/tor.html">Darknet</a>, you&#8217;ll find tools to protect your privacy. Believe me, if you don&#8217;t take steps to do it, no one will do it for you.<br />
We are musicians, artists, programmers and media hackers waving a dark flag proudly displaying the four-P logo. It&#8217;s my hope that we can inspire each other not only to think and speak. But also to act.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Common Law has a long history of preventing persons from being protected from criminal prosecution by the mantle of ignorance. It is likely that this notion has a much longer legal existence in human civilization, as Roman Law expresses the idea as &#8220;ignorantia legis non excusat&#8221; — &#8220;ignorance of the law does not excuse.&#8221; Over the past decade, first and second world societies have introduced an exception clause to this concept which should be taken as a warning sign of a potentially widening crack.<span id="more-8"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make up some nomenclature before proceeding much further; for the remainder of this article, we&#8217;ll refer to an object, whose technical workings are too complex for the randomly chosen person-on-the-street to comprehend, as a &#8216;complex object&#8217;.<br />
Let&#8217;s further sub-divide the set of complex objects into two groups: those of use strictly in the workplace and/or research environments, and the rest. We&#8217;ll ignore the objects in the former group, since there is usually already a strict framework imposed by a government, as well as the business itself in the interest of marketplace image, which results in the education of the users in the usage of those objects.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_0_8" id="identifier_0_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For example: a nuclear reactor.">1</a></sup> As a result, all references to &#8216;complex objects&#8217; will refer to non-business-place-only complex objects.<br />
Lastly, as you&#8217;ve just seen, there will be occasional lapses and a person who uses a complex object will be referred to as a &#8216;user&#8217;.</p>
<hr width="67%" />It&#8217;s not terribly contentious to claim that humans began to be exposed to complex objects on a regular basis with the advent of the industrial revolution. From electricity in the home, to light bulbs, to telephones, to radios, and on and on: we have had a century and more of average people buying complex objects. With the introduction of complex objects to six-pack-Joes-and-Josephines, so came the forced birth of concerns of usability and user interface — the art of taking a process too complex for a person to use and transforming it so that the same person can make use of it. <sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_1_8" id="identifier_1_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="An example would be the modern automobile; in an automobile, a wealth of data which needs to be interpreted and acted upon is generated each second however the user interface of the car weeds out the information which needs to be definitely delivered to the user (ie. present speed) from the information which would befuddle the user (ie. oxygen content in the post-combustion gases).">2</a></sup> The user interfaces on these objects attempted to serve at least three purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>the user of an object is sheltered from having to know about the complex mechanisms working to provide the functionality of the object</li>
<li>the user of an object is heavily discouraged, if not outright prevented, from mucking with the complex mechanisms of the object</li>
<li>the user of an object is protected from performing an action with the object which would cause damage to the user or people immediately around the user</li>
</ol>
<p>It is item #3 which is of the most interest to us here. This protection, on any item, can only do so much. A user intent on circumventing the protection could, for example, rig the door latch mechanism on a microwave so that the oven is able to radiate even with the door open, allowing the user to microwave their own head, foot, or what have you.<br />
It&#8217;s relevant to note that, historically, the great majority of these complex objects could not be used to inflict damage on people other than the user, or others in the user&#8217;s immediate physical vicinity — existence of #3 or not. For objects in which this isn&#8217;t the case,<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_2_8" id="identifier_2_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Our favourite example again: the automobile.">3</a></sup> when the user has caused harm to others society has, at least through the 1980s, uniformly sided with the <em>ignorantia legis non excusat</em> principle.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_3_8" id="identifier_3_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="For example, a defense of &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that attempting to start my manual transmission car while it was in gear would make it lurch forward running over that child.&rdquo; does not fly.">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Then along came personal computers with the 1990s. To be accurate, personal computers came along more than a decade before, but through the 1980s these devices were basically the sole bailiwick of the nerdy, the scientists and the academics. It is not that people of this ilk are infallible concerning the operation of their computers, but rather the personal computers themselves at that time were generally not largely networked nor capable of easily running processes of which the user was unaware.</p>
<p>What the 1990s brought for personal computers was more user friendly interfaces to their operating systems and access to the internet, and with those things so came the general public. Unfortunately both the user interface of the computer and the underlying internet failed our above-item-#3 — what neither the user interfaces did adequately, nor were the internet protocols which facilitate things like email and web traffic designed to do, was to protect stumbling users from themselves.<br />
So then, circa 1998, we had a burgeoning mass of average folk who had enough knowledge of computers to allow them to write documents, play games, and dial-in to the internet for their, albeit slow, fix. Late, but ever welcome, to the party came the final ingredient: always-on-connectivity to the internet, in varied guises like DSL and cable.<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_4_8" id="identifier_4_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Yes, yes.. ISDN was available before this &ndash; but it was the price-point, and wider availability, of DSL, and then cable, which was the flash moment.">5</a></sup> Recapping the guests at our 1998 party, we now had:</p>
<ul>
<li>average shmoes in possession of
<ul>
<li>complex objects with
<ul>
<li>user interfaces that did not protect the users from accessing the underlying complex mechanisms</li>
<li>the ability to be continually interconnected to other complex objects with similar user interface defects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more nefariously shrewd people realized that by exploiting a user&#8217;s naiveté (&#8220;here&#8217;s an email with an attached hot movie of Angelina Jolie topless &#8211; i&#8217;m going to double click it!&#8221;) and/or those user interfaces which were not properly maintained by the user (&#8220;what&#8217;s a Windows update?&#8221;), that they could gain remote control of other people&#8217;s computers. Out of this, it wasn&#8217;t long before the world was introduced to both botnets<sup><a href="https://www.process.org/discept/2007/12/29/a-new-era-in-legal-culpability/#footnote_5_8" id="identifier_5_8" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Groups of computers which were infiltrated to the extent that people could remotely command the computer to perform a given task.">6</a></sup> and rampant personal financial data theft.</p>
<p>It is here, finally, that we&#8217;ve reached the place where our standards of culpability have gone awry; whether the problem is that the user clicked on a link to &#8220;re-verify their online banking login information&#8221;, or they double clicked on an email attachment which set up their machine as part of a botnet, or they forgot to patch their user interface against a long ago discovered  vulnerability – a misstep which led to a key logger being unknowingly installed on their machine – all of these actions share one common theme, one common defense: the users claim of &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know any better.&#8221; What is distressing about these situations is that here we have, seemingly the first time in modern legal history, a free pass based on this claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user&#8217;s computer is one of a large botnet involved in making a government network useless via a DDoS attack? That poor user was a victim too!</li>
<li>The user&#8217;s credit card information captured via a key logger is used to defraud several online shopping sites? That poor user was a victim too&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<hr width="67%" />One conjecture is that this sentiment stems from a societal concensus that the complex object in this case really is too complex to be properly controlled by an average user; this would be troubling for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it sends a message that it&#8217;s ok to be a legal participant of society but still callow</li>
<li>society, at the same time, appears to be making no efforts to curb the acquisition of the complex object by its members (this is an admittedly crappy and unfeasible solution to this particular situation which i wouldnt favour, but it would be at least an action of some flavor &#8211; as opposed to inaction)</li>
<li>it seems likely that the complexity of objects available to the average person is going to continue to increase at a pace which the user interfaces of these objects can not match &#8211; making this scenario reoccur with greater frequency</li>
<li>in those societies whose legal systems weight the notion of precedent, it potentially introduces reduced culpability in other situations</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the underlying reason, we, as a society, need to reflect on whether we really want to endorse the concept that a person&#8217;s ignorance absolves them of their actions which inflict damage on others. Should we choose to endorse such a thing, it likely won&#8217;t be long before ignorance is advocated over intelligence as a general theme to individual existence.</p>
